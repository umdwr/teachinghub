Observations and Course Reviews
===============================
The DWR requires all teachers to be observed and all online courses to be reviewed on a regular basis. Please use this interface to record and submit observations and course reviews for face-to-face and online DWR classes. For help with this system, please contact `Andrew Davis. <mailto:addavis@olemiss.edu>`_
