About the Corequisite Course
-----------------------------
Corequisite Writing 100 combines the DWR’s introductory course to academic writing, Writing 100, with a corequisite course, designed to support students’ work in Writing 100 while simultaneously fulfilling the DS 98 requirement.  Corequisite Writing 100 meets five days per week, with Writing 100 scheduled on M/W/F and the corequisite course scheduled on T/Th. Upon successful completion of the course, students move into Writing 102 or Liberal Arts 102.

The corequisite course mirrors the sequence of Writing 100 with a focus on drafting and revising the major projects as well as journaling, discussing readings, working in small groups, and examining ways to improve writing.

The grade for the corequisite course is comprised equally of attendance, preparation, participation, and the journal.
