<em>Note: In 2020, we are transitioning away from the "Commonplace Book" designation in favor of "Reflection Blog." </em>
<br>
<br>
<p>DWR Reflection Blogs make use of the <a href="http://edblogs.olemiss.edu/">Edblogs@UM</a> platform. Edblogs is based on WordPress, so if you’ve kept a blog before, you’ll be very familiar with the interface. This page of the guide should address any technical concerns you have with using student blogs in the classroom.</p>

<p>There are two ways to connect to your students' blogs. You may have students add you as a user to their sites and use WordPress Reader to access their posts or you may use the "My Class" plugin to centrally manage your students' sites. Instructions for both methods are below.</p>

<h3>Classes</h3>
The Classes plugin connects you to student blogs in a teacher/students configuration. Even if you don't plan to maintain a class blog, you'll need to have one in order to use "My Class." Your default blog is located at "edblogs.olemiss.edu/MY-WEB-ID." Many teachers use their default blog as a class blog. (If your default blog is not set up for some reason, go to the <a href="https://edblogs.olemiss.edu/wp-signup.php">EdBlogs Signup Page</a> to create a new one).

<strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-2069 size-thumbnail" src="http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/createclass-150x150.jpg" alt="My Class > Create Class" width="150" height="150" /></strong>To activate your class blog, go to the dashboard of the site you want to use as your class blog (probably your default site) and click <strong>My Class</strong> and <strong>Create a Class. </strong>

On the Settings page, check the box next to <strong>This is a class blog. </strong>

This will enable the rest of the settings and options for the Classes plugin. Here is an explanation of each one:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Allow students to post on the class blog: </strong>Only change this setting if you want to require students to post to <em>your</em> blog in addition to their own. Most teachers do not do this. If you decide to use the class blog in this way, you can decide whether you want to moderate student posts.</li>
 	<li><strong>Moderation on student blogs: </strong>Most teachers leave these boxes unchecked. This function is primarily for K-12 teachers who use the Campus Press platform.</li>
 	<li><strong>Privacy: </strong>Set student site privacy to <strong>Only registered users of this site can view it </strong>by default unless you have a specific justification for requiring public student blogs. The nature of the Commonplace Book assignment lends itself to private blogs.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reader: </strong>Leave this option unchecked unless you want students in your class to have access to each other's posts. If you want to create peer review groups or reading pairs, adding individual users is a better option.</li>
 	<li><strong>Teachers:</strong> If you are team teaching a course or want to invite another teacher to observe your class blog, you can add other users as Teachers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Student Permissions: </strong>Check all the boxes to grant students full control over their sites. The Commonplace Book assignment is predicated on student ownership of the digital space, so there's no good reason to restrict access to WordPress core functions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Default Blog Template: </strong>You can automatically assign the Commonplace Book template to new student blogs <em>only</em> if you use the <strong>Invite</strong> function or request a batch job to enable your class blog at the beginning of the semester.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding Student Blogs to the Class</h2>
Students can request to be added to your class blog by going to <strong>My Class > Join a Class </strong>from their WordPress dashboard (after they've created a site).
<br/>
<br/>
They should search for your class blog by entering just the last part of your class blog’s URL. For example, for <strong>edblogs.olemiss.edu/mysite, </strong>students will instead search for the last part of the URL. Using this example, they would search for <strong>mysite.</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
You can approve student join requests by clicking on <strong>My Class </strong>and selecting which students you want to approve.
<br/>
<br/>
You can have your class blog set up <a href="https://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/edblogs/">automatically through the Teaching Hub</a>. We recommend waiting until week 2 before requesting an automatic setup to give your class roll a chance to stabilize.

<h3> Reader Lists</h3>
<p>You do not need a separate class blog to use Reader lists to read student Commonplace Books. This option does not use the Classes plugin and instead relies on WordPress's native subscription/user system.</p>

 
<h2>Creating Reader Lists</h2>
<p>Instead of pulling your class rolls from MyOleMiss, this time you'll pull them from Blackboard.</p>

<p><strong>Go to the Full Grade Center</strong> in your Blackboard course. From the toolbar at the top of your gradebook, click "Work Offline" and select "Download."</p>

<img class="alignleft wp-image-757 size-full" src="http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1-1.png" alt="" width="1925" height="402" />

<p><strong>On the "Download Grades</strong>" page under "Data," select "User Information Only." Leave the rest of the options the same, and click "Submit."</p>

<img class="alignleft wp-image-759 size-full" src="http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2-2.png" alt="" width="1571" height="1394" />

<p><strong>On the next screen, click "Download</strong>.<strong>"</strong> You can save the file to your computer or open it directly in Excel. You will see the following warning message. Click Yes:</p>

<img class="alignleft wp-image-760 size-full" src="http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/3-1.png" alt="" width="1797" height="243" />

<p><strong>The spreadsheet</strong> will show the first and last names of the students in the section and their usernames. Click and drag to select all the usernames in your class, and copy them to your clipboard (Ctrl/Cmd + C).</p>

<img class="wp-image-761 aligncenter" src="http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/4-1.png" alt="" width="331" height="634" />

<p><strong>Now, log in to Edblogs at <a href="http://edblogs.olemiss.edu">edblogs.olemiss.edu</a></strong>. Go to your WordPress dashboard. You should see the Reader. Notice "My Lists" in the right sidebar.</p>

<img class="alignleft wp-image-762 size-full" src="http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5-1.png" alt="" width="1679" height="1147" />

<p><strong>Click "Create New List."</strong> You can name the list by section if you want to divide your reader by section. Or, if you want all your students combined, just name the list with the semester. Paste the usernames that you copied from the Excel spreadsheet into the box and click "Create."</p>

<img class="wp-image-763 aligncenter" src="http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6-1.png" alt="" width="291" height="300" />

<p><strong>You can now click on the list from your Reader</strong> to view only the student blogs from the named section or semester. You can manage the list by clicking the small sprocket next to its name. From the manage screen, you can add or remove student blogs or delete the list completely.</p>

<img class="alignleft wp-image-765 size-full" src="http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/7-2.png" alt="" width="1437" height="1085" />

<p><strong>You can repeat this process</strong> for multiple sections if you keep your classes separated.</p>
