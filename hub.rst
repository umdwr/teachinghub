Welcome to the Writing 102 Assignment Library. This library is organized
by major unit. Where applicable, each assignment's page is subdivided by
course theme.

WRIT 102 (First-Year Writing II) is a theme-based, first-year writing
course designed to build on writing skills learned in either WRIT 100 or
WRIT 101 and develop critical thinking and research skills appropriate
for use in academic writing. The course pays special attention to
developing argumentative skills, analyzing texts, and synthesizing
information into thoughtful, coherent essays and projects. Students
enrolled in WRIT 102 will produce papers that are longer and more
in-depth than in WRIT 100/101. The course culminates in a final
portfolio of the student’s work.

Course Outcomes
---------------

The objectives of this course are

1. to develop basic writing skills learned in WRIT 100/101, including
   the understanding that writing is a process that develops over time
2. to write for specific purposes and for specific audiences,
3. to respond critically to different points of view, allowing the
   student to create effective and sustainable arguments,
4. to become skilled at locating primary and secondary research from a
   variety of sources and at evaluating their reliability, and
5. to become effective researchers and writers of research papers as a
   member of an active writing, reading, and researching community.

Thinking <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/alib/writ102/criticalthinking>`__

Paper #1 is an analysis of a single text. This can be a response paper
to an author’s argument or a profile or analysis of a person, place, or
thing. It should be 3-4 pages with at least a single entry on the Works
Cited page and is worth 10% of the student’s final grade.

Areas to highlight: This assignment will help students learn to look
closely at a text (academic or otherwise) and begin the fundamentals of
quoting and citation. Because some students may have had a disruption in
time between a WRIT 100/101/equivalent course and a WRIT 102 course
(even if it is only winter break), it is recommended that instructors go
over thesis statements and paragraph construction that students should
have learned in WRIT 100/101. Students may also need help in
understanding the difference between summary and analysis.

The multimodal assignment revises the research paper into another mode.
This assignment is worth 15% of the student’s final grade.

Areas to highlight: This assignment is perhaps the most individualized
by theme; however, problems with technology will the biggest issue.
Instructors should take advantage of Andrew Davis (Lamar Hall Ste. B, Rm
22) to learn how to teach the technology to students. Instructors should
keep in mind that this assignment can be as low or high tech as wanted.
In general, since this assignment is most often paired with the research
papers, students may be tired of their subject or be reluctant to cut
their papers. Further, failures in the paper version may translate to
problems with the multimodal project. Try to return the research paper
back as quickly as possible to alleviate this issue and try not to
double-penalize them.

   </iframe>

Paper #3 is the research paper where students will come up with their
research question in the context of the class theme. This paper should
be 7-9 pages and use at least seven credible sources. This assignment is
worth 20% of the student’s final grade.

Areas to highlight: This is the most intimidating assignment for
students. Many of them may have never written this length of paper. Some
may have only written an “informational” research paper and not an
argumentative one. Since the class spends nearly a month of class
periods on this assignment, the sequence of homework assignments,
in-class work, and other elements of the process are important to a
student’s success. Several class periods should be spent on developing a
research question alone. This special care and attention will make the
process much more manageable. Emphasize their many avenues of support –
the instructor, their peers, the consultants in the Writing Center, and
the reference librarians.

From the `Online Writing Lab at
Purdue <https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/owlprint/980/>`__,
“Synthesize means that you combine information in a way that could
coherently and effectively present your ideas or opinions. In some
assignments, you will be required to synthesize sources or ideas. This
means that you will combine the sources and ideas and organize them in a
way that is appropriate and approachable to your readers.”

After much discussion and analysis of the way instructors develop and
execute the synthesis paper assignment, the WRIT 102 curriculum
committee offers two different tracks for the instructor, although each
informs the other: one focuses on research and the other focuses on
composition.

In either track, the committee agrees that the synthesis essay should
have the following outcomes:

The student will:

-  Write a 4-6 page essay with at least two, but no more than three,
   sources cited in a given citation style
-  Create and support a thesis using these sources
-  Select and evaluate high-quality, contextually relevant sources with
   an identifiable thesis, either stated or implied
-  Engage critically with sources by analyzing and evaluating source
   contexts and positions
-  Move beyond simple compare and contrast in blending (or integrating)
   sources
-  Address underlying assumptions and common themes within the sources
-  Become more comfortable with citation and good quoting/paraphrasing
   in preparation for the research essay

Analysis Options
----------------

In an analysis, a writer closely examines an issue or an artifact,
systematically breaking down and considering the components, as well as
the context in which it was constructed, to posit an interpretation or
evaluation. This assignment has several flavors based on *The New York
Times*.

In argument, students make a claim and support that claim with evidence.
While instructors may assign for this project different types of
argument, the assignment should require background information on the
topic as context for the argument, a clearly-expressed main claim,
evidence, integration of outside sources, and refutation of
counter-arguments. Argument is roughly a three-week unit.

Areas to highlight: Students often need help narrowing a topic to a
specific, debatable claim. Some students struggle to provide enough
specific evidence to support their claims and need help brainstorming
places to find evidence. Students often need help integrating quoted
material and paraphrases into their texts as well as documenting their
sources. Students may also need help considering opposing viewpoints or
counterarguments and refutation.

The commonplace book is a personalized space for recording, organizing,
and reflecting on a student’s learning. This semester-long project
incorporates daily, weekly, and unit reflections, culminating in a final
reflective post (called an epilogue).

Areas to highlight: Many students will have practiced self-reflection
and metacognition in WRIT 100/101, and WRIT 102 should build from this
foundation. However, students who placed out of WRIT 100/101 may not
have had much practice at all. In general, many will need help with
being more specific about their learning. Students may have difficulty
demonstrating their progress, or lack thereof, through examples, often
resorting to more telling than showing. Students may also struggle to
understand how tagging can be a mechanism to represent the larger
structures of their learning. In WRIT 102, it is also a challenge to
make this assignment fresh and engaging rather than rote and reflexive.

The in-class essay is a timed writing exercise where students may do
similar work as in papers 1 and 2 in that students might be asked to
respond to a particular text or argument or evaluate a text’s argument.
This may be related to paper #3, the research paper. The in-class essay
is worth 5% of the student’s final grade.

Areas to highlight: Timed writing can be intimidating to many students.
Going over strategies to alleviate stress will be useful for this
assignment and any future essay exam. Because the writing is so short,
students may believe the writing process does not apply but instructors
should model how to use brainstorming/outlining, drafting, and revision
in this context, with special attention to time management. Students who
do not do well in this assignment often do not prepare well for the
in-class essay (by not bringing a required essay or optional notes) or
do not read the prompt carefully. These areas should be addressed;
Instructors may also opt for a practice timed essay in class.

The first-semester, first-year writing courses—WRIT 100 and WRIT 101—use
the Common Reading Text as the basis for the first major writing
project. This project emphasizes the critical reading, critical
thinking, analysis, research, and synthesis skills that are vital to
college writing. In this assignment, students are given a prompt
pertaining to the Common Reading Text and asked to compose an essay that
integrates the Common Reading Text with outside sources and the
student’s own ideas. First-year writing courses use the Common Reading
Text as a basis for student reading and writing rather than as a
literary study.

Welcome to the LIBA 102 Assignment Library. This library is organized by
major unit. Where applicable, each assignment's page is subdivided by
course theme.

LIBA 102 is a first-year writing course conducted within the context of
a research area within a specific discipline designed to build on
writing abilities learned in WRIT 100/101. The course works to develop
critical thinking and research abilities appropriate for use in academic
writing within a particular discipline. The course pays special
attention to developing argumentation, analysis of texts, and synthesis
of information into thoughtful, coherent written projects. Students
enrolled in LIBA 102 produce papers that are longer and more in depth
than in WRIT 100/101. The course culminates in a final portfolio of the
student’s work.

Course Outcomes
---------------

The objectives of this course are

1. to develop writing abilities learned in WRIT 100/101, including the
   understanding that writing is a process that develops over time
   through revision.
2. to write for specific purposes and for specific audiences.
3. to respond critically to different points of view so that the student
   creates effective and sustained arguments.
4. to become proficient at locating primary and secondary research from
   a variety of sources and at evaluating the reliability of sources.
5. to become effective researchers and writers of research papers as a
   member of an active writing, reading, and researching community,
   understanding that such writing should be free of serious grammatical
   and mechanical errors while following disciplinary writing
   conventions.

In analysis, students examine an issue or an artifact’s component parts
to understand how it makes meaning. The analysis project is usually the
hardest project for students because they don’t have much experience
with it and have difficulty moving past summary. Analysis is roughly a
three-week unit.

Areas to highlight: Many students are unaccustomed to examining
individual parts of an issue or an artifact and may need guidance in
breaking down the whole. Often, students struggle with identifying an
analytic thesis that answers the questions how, why, and/or so what.
Once students have a draft in place, the most common problems are
organization and focus. It is not uncommon for a student to try to cover
many different ideas. These writers need help organizing their thoughts
and focusing their essays. Students sometimes struggle with providing
enough specific evidence to support their analyses. These writers may
need to be alerted to areas that would benefit from additional evidence.

In argument, students make a claim and support that claim with evidence.
While instructors may assign for this project different types of
argument, the assignment should require background information on the
topic as context for the argument, a clearly-expressed main claim,
evidence, integration of outside sources, and refutation of
counter-arguments. Argument is roughly a three-week unit.

Areas to highlight: Students often need help narrowing a topic to a
specific, debatable claim. Some students struggle to provide enough
specific evidence to support their claims and need help brainstorming
places to find evidence. Students often need help integrating quoted
material and paraphrases into their texts as well as documenting their
sources. Students may also need help considering opposing viewpoints or
counterarguments and refutation.

The commonplace book is a personalized space for recording, organizing,
and reflecting on a student’s learning. This semester-long project
incorporates daily, weekly, and unit reflections, culminating in a final
reflective post.

Areas to highlight: Students are generally unfamiliar with
self-reflection and metacognition and need many opportunities throughout
the semester to practice. Many will need help with being more specific
about their learning. Students may have difficulty demonstrating their
progress, or lack thereof, through examples, often resorting to more
telling than showing. Students may also struggle to understand how
tagging can be a mechanism to represent the larger structures of their
learning.

In the multimodal assignment, students re-work or re-think an earlier
project in a different mode or medium. Multimodal is roughly a two-week
project.

Areas to highlight: Students often don’t recognize that a change in mode
or medium requires a change in technique, so students need help in
understanding how electronic, visual, or spoken text is different from
print text and, thus, how to think about audience. Students may also
need help with unfamiliar technology.

The first-semester, first-year writing courses—WRIT 100 and WRIT 101—use
the Common Reading Text as the basis for the first major writing
project. This project emphasizes the critical reading, critical
thinking, analysis, research, and synthesis skills that are vital to
college writing. In this assignment, students are given a prompt
pertaining to the Common Reading Text and asked to compose an essay that
integrates the Common Reading Text with outside sources and the
student’s own ideas. First-year writing courses use the Common Reading
Text as a basis for student reading and writing rather than as a
literary study.

[expand title="Blair, Kritine and Cheryl Hoy. (2006). Paying Attention
to Adult Learners Online: The Pedagogy and Politics of Community\_.
Computers and Composition, 23 (1)\_. 32-48."]

This study looks specifically at adult learners in online composition
class, but makes a number of conclusions that apply equally well to all
online learners. Hoy and Blair write about a fully online course in
Bowling Green’s “Prior Learning Assessment Program,” which assesses what
kind of credit students should get for existing experience and
expertise. The study focuses chiefly on the online interactions between
adult non-traditional students and the instructors, but also how the
students interact with each other. The most useful takeaway from the
article is its illustration that instruction in online writing classes
often takes place “outside” the course. Private emails, chats, and other
types of interaction taking place beyond the “walls” of the LMS often
make up the most substantive teaching, in this case of adult distance
learners specifically. This can create problems for assessment and
administration, as there is no good way to track this interaction
(though I’d argue that the same thing happens in f2f writing courses).
The specific analyses of interactions between student and instructor are
useful and applicable for our classrooms (especially WRIT 250).

[expand title="Brown, Victoria. (2011) Changing Demographics of Online
Courses. *US-China Education Review*, *8 (4).* 460-467."]

This article explores different issues that may affect the learning
styles of learners who chose online classes as opposed to face-to-face
classes. The “Grasha-Riechmann student learning student style scales”
was used in the study to determine the learning styles of students in
either online or face-to-face classes. Ultimately, the difference
between learning styles vs. online or face-to-face class is becoming
less of a concern for students and convenience is the main impetus in
the choice of online or in-class instruction.

Early studies suggested online students were more independent learners,
but recent studies narrow the gap between the personality of the
face-to-face student and the online student. Brown suggests the improved
communication tools and instructional strategies that promote social
presence in these courses as another reason for the growing population
of online students.

The author also notes a familiarity with the online teaching concept as
a reason for choosing the online format because of so many hybrid
classes being offered at universities and many high school students have
some experience with online interfaces such as Blackboard. So as
students feel more comfortable with the online course experience they
are now demanding it more.

The study suggests the student is making decisions based on convenience
for both online and face-to-face. For online students the convenience
may concern time-management and on-campus students are concerned about
location. Those students taking on-campus classes are more concerned
about their learning style when selecting face-to-face classes, but also
their desired class may not have been offered online or all online
classes were full. “With new technology tools available, professors are
going to be able to address learning styles in distance classes in
numerous ways” (Brown). The study suggests that learning styles will
become less of an issue with less text-based online classes and more
multimedia based. In future studies of who is taking online classes:
“Understanding of learning styles research could be redirected from who
are attending classes to how students with different learning styles use
the different types of tools available to interact with instructional
materials” (Brown). [/expand]

 

[expand title="DePew, Kevin and Heather Lettner-Rust. (2009) Mediating
Power: Distance Learning Interfaces, Classroom Epistemology, and the
Gaze. *Computers and Composition, 26.* 174-189"]

DePew and Lettner-Rust examine how the interfaces used for online
instruction affect both the pedagogy and the power dynamics between
teachers and students. The authors note that online interfaces (and
institutional training for online instructors) have traditionally
supported a banking model of education - lectures, quizzes, etc. - but
argue that such an approach is not effective for writing instruction.
Instead, they propose a problem-solving approach, and their case
studies, conducted at Old Dominion University, examine how three types
of interfaces might support and hinder such an approach. The
correspondence course model confines interaction to asynchronous textual
exchanges between teacher and student. Students aren’t visible to the
instructor, which DePew and Rust argue can be beneficial, since
instructors can’t make the kinds of judgments based on appearance that
might negatively affect their perceptions of their students. The
simulated classroom (like Blackboard) is the most familiar to us as
writing instructors. These interfaces allow for interaction between
students as well as between student and instructor. They also enable
instructors to monitor exchanges between students, perhaps better than
they could in a traditional classroom. The final interface discussed is
synchronous video. Primarily used for lecture, the available interfaces
for synchronous video communication disrupt the gaze (through camera
angles, bad connections, etc.), making it impossible to replicate the
kinds of interaction that take place in the traditional classroom. But
DePew and Rust argue that these interfaces also empower students to
choose how they appear (students can manipulate the angles of their
webcams, for instance), altering the power dynamic in the student’s
favor. The authors ultimately suggest that a combination of interfaces
seems likely to provide the best support for a problem-solving
pedagogical approach. They go on to suggest further examination - at the
institutional level, of how technological interfaces shape teaching
practices. [/expand]

This blog post examines a lawsuit that Roni Loren, a *New York Times*
bestselling author, went through because she inadvertently posted a
copyrighted photograph on her blog. Loren was served with a DMCA
(takedown) notice, and although she quickly complied, was sued for
compensation by the photographer. In this post, Loren shares her story,
and cautions others regarding the use of images not only on blogs, but
on social media sites like Tumbler and Pinterest. Loren offers advice on
where you can locate safe images to use (i.e. Creative Commons,
Wikipedia Commons, etc.) while outlining some little known facts about
Fair Use, and why blogs are not usually protected under it. Loren also
admits that her ignorance in the matter is no excuse, and that she was
clearly in the wrong. This would be an excellent post to share with
students as they begin working on their multimodal projects. Although,
projects completed for educational purposes due tend to fall under the
protection of fair use, it would enable students to better understand
why we are so very strict regarding citation; it does have real world
applications that are very important. [/expand]

 

[expand title="Miller, Susan. (2001). A Review of research on distance
education in *Computers and Composition*. *Computers and Composition,
18*. 423-30" ]

This article is a literature review of 12 published journal articles
from 1994-1999 that Miller splits into two categories—ones that discuss
theoretical writing issues in distance education and ones that discuss
practical applications of writing instruction online. However, her
review of each is too brief to offer much detailed information and thus
functions more like an annotated bibliography. Her short summary of each
article only prompts the reader to know which articles might be worth
reading. So, for instance, we learn that “Royar (1994) introduced
critical questioning of the nature of online writing classes, and
Quigley (1994) expanded that inquiry to question the nature of online
syllabi for writing courses . . . Buckley (1997) introduced critical
theorizing of the subject position of the online writing teacher, and
Lang (1998) raised questions of intellectual property” (425). All the
articles in the practice section focus on how to use online technology
to facilitate collaboration between separate parties—as between a
college and a high school writing class or between a mentor and mentee
at the college level. These pieces are of interest but may be too
outdated now. It’s a short piece that is could act as a good jumping off
point for someone looking for a quick literature review when conducting
their own research. [/expand]

 

[expand title="Meyer, Katrina A. (2014).How Community College Faculty
Members May Improve Student Learning Productivity in Their Online
Courses. *Community College Journal of Research and Practice,* *38 (6).*
575-87."]

The study discusses the legislative push for more productivity in
postsecondary education at the same time the economy is struggling;
therefore, online learning is offered as a cost-effective method to save
money, while also enabling students to receive a quality education.
Meyer claims (through research) that online learning is the perfect
balance between efficiency and productivity; it's a win-win for
administration, faculty, and students. Meyer also mentions the growth in
online learning.

Meyer’s study included 11 full-time instructors who have taught more
than 10 online courses. Five southern states, and three western states
were represented. Nine subjects were also included. The researcher's aim
was to locate themes or consistencies in productive practices in online
education. Basically, what helped students learn? Interviews with the 11
participants provided three themes: increasing student engagement,
providing structure, and assessing learning.

What we can use from this study is that the participating instructors
referenced the importance of the first week of the course, and mentioned
that being available to help students understand how the course works
during that time is crucial. Also, one instructor leads a discussion
board that discusses student fears regarding learning online during the
first week; I found this to be a most interesting idea. Another idea
worth noting was put forth by a writing instructor who claimed that
their use of making peer review worth up to 20% of the course grade
improved students reading and editing abilities. The study also
mentioned the idea of learning from other experienced instructors, as
well as learning and adapting through continued experience with teaching
online courses.

[expand title="Patricia Patterson. (2001). The Debate about Online
Learning: Key Issues for Writing Teachers. *Computers and Composition,
18.* 359-70"]

Patricia Webb Patterson joins the call to critically examine methods for
online instruction, but she frames this project in terms of concerns
about the corporatization of the academy. Addressing the resistance
faculty members often feel about online courses, Patterson reminds us
that, because of the advent of email, and because online courses are
heavily textual in nature, “the primary interface of a distance-learning
course is the written word,” making “writing teachers' expertise”
crucial in developing the very heart of online instruction (359). Thus,
even for writing instructors reluctant to teach online, it is crucial
for all writing faculty not only to pay attention to the development of
online teaching but to participate in this development as one of its
leading voices. Acknowledging that resistance to online instruction
often fears the corporatization of the academy, Patterson points out
that simply ignoring the spread of online instruction doesn't solve this
perceived problem. Instructors who refuse to participate in online
instruction are merely “abdicat[ing] their responsibility to actively
participate in the shaping of new roles for instructors” (362), a
posture that Patterson critiques as counterproductive. Pinpointing the
false dichotomy such resistance creates between “either choosing
distance learning and selling out on our belief systems or holding true
to our belief systems and resisting distance learning” (363), Patterson
believes that developing online instruction does not relegate scholars
to the role of mere corporate trainers. Participating in the development
of online courses allows any and all writing instructors to benefit,
since debates about course design ultimately revolve around reaching
newer, more diverse students in newer, more diverse ways. Through online
courses, the academy can explore new ways to teach what to many writing
instructors is an old and traditional skill. This article would be
useful for anyone researching the history of academic resistance to
writing instruction, particularly because of the ways Patterson
addresses and debunks such counterarguments [/expand]

 

[expand title="Selfe, Cynthia L. (1999). Technology and literacy: A
story about the perils of not paying attention. *College Composition and
Communication, 50.* 411–436."]

While a bit dated, Cynthia Selfe's article (“Technology and Literacy”)
highlights the fact that technology hasn’t always been central to
writing instruction, and in fact met much of the same resistance in 1999
it still meets today. Ascribing this resistance to an insistence on
humanism—centering writing instruction on the human instead of the
machine—Selfe issues a call for writing instructors not only to use
technology more, but also to examine their use of this technology
critically. Thus, while championing the use of technology in writing
instruction, Selfe cautions against the technology-for-technology's-sake
argument: novelty doesn't always translate to utility. Focusing on the
Clinton-Gore administration's *Getting Children Ready for the
Twenty-First Century* initiative (1996), Selfe asks us to pay attention
to the fact that technological literacy doesn't always lead to automatic
success, either. Citing socioeconomic barriers that prevent Black and
Hispanic people from having equal access to technology, Selfe asks us to
be mindful in our use of technology, acknowledging that, even if we take
this resource for granted, this resource isn't guaranteed for all.
Because of these factors, “we have little evidence that any large-scale
project focusing on a narrowly defined set of officially sanctioned
literacy skills will result in fundamental changes in the ratio of
people labeled as literate or illiterate” (423). So the burden rests on
us as writing instructors to increase technological literacy, which,
Selfe argues, must play a central role in any robust writing program.
This article would prove useful for anyone researching the history of
writing instruction since 2000, particularly for highlighting the
political implications of technology literacy in a writing course

organizing one's course as modules or units, providing audio and visual

*Creating a video to welcome students*

There are a number of ways you can go about creating a welcome video.
Some instructors like a “talking head” intro video, while others prefer
a screen recording of the Blackboard course, or even a PowerPoint. Some
things to keep in mind for your welcome video:

-  Keep your video short. Anything longer than 4-5 minutes won’t get
   watched. 3 minutes is the sweet spot for video content.
-  If you want to show your face, make sure your background is clear of
   any distractions. If you’re using your laptop webcam, move to a room
   where you can have a blank wall as your background.
-  If you don’t have access to a higher-quality microphone, it is best
   to record your video in an extremely quiet room or office without
   much echo.
-  If you want to create your welcome video as a screencast, make sure
   you are in Student Preview mode, and that your browser is running in
   In-Private/Incognito mode, and that all other tabs or otherwise
   distracting things are minimized.

Tools:

-  Screencast-o-matic (http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/) is the best
   screen recording tool available for free. Be sure to export your
   video to YouTube and caption it.
-  You can record your webcam from Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, then
   export to YouTube.
-  PowerPoints can be exported as videos, and uploaded to Youtube.

*Instructions on embedding a video in Blackboard:*

Though Blackboard does include a YouTube “mashup” for embedding YouTube
content, in our experience this is not the best way of getting your
videos into your course. The mashup feature does not work for unlisted
videos, and if the title of your video uses generic language, it may be
impossible to find.

The embed code generated by YouTube itself is your best bet. When you
select “embed” from the share options under a YouTube video, you can
“Show More” to see customization options. Generally, 640x360 is a good
size for videos in a Blackboard course. We recommend showing player
controls and enabling privacy-enhanced mode. Once the settings match
what you want to embed in your course, copy the embed code to your
clipboard.

|embedding a youTube video|

Then, go to the content area in your Blackboard course where you want to
put the video. Click “Build Content” and select “Item.” In the content
editor, click the “HTML” button and paste the embed code from YouTube.
When you submit the item, you should see your YouTube video in the
content area.

[expand title="Office Hours" tag="h4"]

Holding office hours virtually can be tricky. How do you provide the
accessibility your students’ need, especially if you live in a different
town or city? What’s the best way to help your students with assignments
from afar? What do students find most comfortable and convenient for
them? There are several options to make your office hours convenient for
both you and your students.

Here is the Department of Writing & Rhetoric’s policy regarding office
hours:

*Teachers in the W&R are expected to hold regular office hours for the
purpose of supporting the teaching mission through student conferencing.
All teachers in the W&R are asked to hold a minimum of one weekly office
hour per section taught, but no less than two hours per week. Please
submit your office hours, posted on your syllabus, electronically to
Glenn Schove no later than three working days prior to the first day of
classes each semester.*

In order to fulfill the Department’s policy, you will need to maintain
between two to four office hours per week (depending on the number of
sections you teach). These are times that your students should be able
to contact you to discuss their writing. Here are several options that
online students tend to favor:

-  Continually check email during your posted office hours (remain
   logged into email account). We have found that most students tend to
   prefer to communicate through email rather than video conferencing or
   by phone.
-  You can provide students with a phone number to call to discuss their
   writing during office hours.
-  You can leave a video conferencing meeting open in a specified
   platform, letting students know they can access it at any time during
   your office hours to conference.
-  You can also combine several of these, or offer all of them,
   depending on your and your students’ preferences. For example, you
   can leave your email running during your office hours, and let
   students know they can email to ask questions, or email to request a
   video conference. At which time, you can send them a link to meet.

The most important thing is to let your students know that you are
available to assist them with the various writing and multimodal
assignments they will compose during the semester. It is also vital that
you provide clear instruction as to how your office hours will work, and
how students can take advantage of that time if they so choose. The best
way to do this is to create an “Office Hours” tab in blackboard. When
students click that tab, they should be able to read when you are
available, and how they can access whatever platform you choose to use
during office hours.

We have also noticed that online students tend to have very demanding
schedules, where they balance work, school, and families. For this
reason, we highly recommend that you remain available to meet with
students by appointment. That way, if your office hours are not
convenient for some students, they will know they can still meet you
with at a mutually convenient time.

[expand title="How Do I Conference with Online Students?" tag="h4"]

*Face-to-face*: If you are currently residing in Oxford, you may elect
to schedule face-to-face conferences with your online students. Many
traditional students seem to like this option because they get to “see”
their instructor. That said, be sure to remain flexible. In our
experience, many students enroll in an online class because their
schedules are hectic; therefore, you may want to offer students options
for conferencing. Here are several other options for conferencing with
students:

*Zoom*: Some of us currently use Zoom to conference with our students;
it is a free online service that enables you to meet for forty minutes
(do note that one way around this hurdle is to exit out between student
meetings, and then quickly reenter your chat room). You can talk using
webcams, or you can simply instigate an audio conference (an option that
enables you to use your computer speakers). You can also screen share
and use a chat feature with students; it provides an array of options
that making conferencing easy. One such feature is that students can
attend the conferences using their smartphones. To learn more about
Zoom, visit this link: https://zoom.us

*Email*: Scheduling a time for a conference can sometimes be difficult
for students enrolled in many courses, or are working full time (one
example would be a student one of us taught who worked the third shift
at a casino in Tunica). For these students, we tend to allow them the
opportunity to email a draft with questions. You can return their draft
with comments and feedback to those questions, as well as other
suggestions you may have for revision. We have found that many students
enrolled in an online course prefer the convenience and flexibility that
this option provides. Although at first you may be apprehensive of
whether this constituted a “conference,” we have found that if you
encourage students to reply with further questions or concerns, that
this does become a “conference.” Do note that this option does tend to
be more time-consuming for the instructor.

[expand title="Students who are MIA" tag="h4"]

What to do with students that do not complete work, but refuse to drop
the course:

In an online class, you will have students who completely disappear.
They will not log in to Blackboard for weeks, and will stop completing
work. Here are a few tips to help keep your students engaged in an
online platform:

-  Email your students on the first day of class to introduce yourself
   and the course. Be sure to give them specific instructions on how to
   begin their work for that week and navigate the course’s Blackboard
   shell.
-  After the first week of class, check for students who failed to
   complete their work. Send them an email that gently reminds them that
   they are in an online class, that assignments are due, give them a
   new deadline for the missed assignments, and then ask if there is
   anything you can do to help them better navigate the online course.
-  Another possible approach to the drop-add problem might be to make
   the move the first deadline for any coursework after the drop-add
   deadline. It’s possible to check the Registrar’s website
   (http://registrar.olemiss.edu/academic-calendar-menu/) to verify the
   drop-add deadline for each semester, and schedule the first 1-2
   weeks’ worth of work to accommodate this deadline.
-  As a general practice, I have found it helpful to email students on
   Mondays to remind them of upcoming assignments that will be due that
   week. I always end these emails by reassuring students that I would
   love to answer any questions they might have. This email not only
   reminds them of upcoming assignments, but also lets them know that
   you are available to help. This makes the class feel less “virtual,”
   and more “real” for students.
-  After each major assignment, compile a list of students that failed
   to submit the assignment, and then email them to remind them of the
   course’s late policy (if you have one). I tend to put smiley faces in
   my emails (a strange practice, I know) so that students know that I
   am not angry with them; it tends to help them understand that you are
   approachable for questions and concerns regarding the late policy and
   the assignment.

Also, please know that it is very NORMAL for some students to fail to
respond to your repeated requests to complete and submit work. As long
as you notify them about missed assignments, you have done your job as a
supportive but challenging teacher. Ultimately, you cannot make each
student submit their work for your course, but you can take comfort in
knowing that you tried everything to help them succeed.

[expand title="Academic Honesty/Plagiarism" tag="h4"]

*Reporting Plagiarism to the Academic Discipline Committee*

There seems to be a myth that reporting a student who commits blatant
plagiarism (not careless citations) to the Academic Discipline Committee
somehow “ruins a student’s educational career.” This is false. The
reality is that if the Committee finds the student guilty and it is the
first offence, then the sanctions recommended by the Instructor are the
only ones enforced—failure of the assignment and of the course. The
student’s name then goes into a private database so that if the student
is reported a second time, the sanctions will become more stringent. For
first-time plagiarists (and contrary to the popular myth), there is
nothing printed on the student’s transcript, nor sent to their parents,
nor reported to future professors, nor risk of academic probation or
suspension. The only consequence is the instructor’s sanction of failing
the class. If the instructor fails to report a case of plagiarism to the
Committee, however, and the student plagiarizes again, there is no
record that the student is a serial plagiarist.

Therefore, all Instructors who determine this type of serious
plagiarism, should follow the DWR policy on plagiarism here:
http://rhetoric.olemiss.edu/teachers/resources/policies/ and to help
initiate the case, below is a step-by-step guide. Initiating the
plagiarism case is done through myOleMiss:

1. Under “Student Services,” select “Academic Discipline” |1. Under
   “Student Services,” select “Academic Discipline”|
2. Then, select the semester and year of the student. |2. Then, select
   the semester and year of the student.|
3. Find the section that the student is enrolled in, and choose
   “Academic Discipline—Initiate” from the menu. |3. Find the section
   that the student is enrolled in, and choose “Academic
   Discipline—Initiate” from the menu.|
4. Choose the student’s name and click “Initiate Case.” |image5|
5. Select the sanctions based on the DWR policy and your discussion with
   the department chair. Then, scroll down to complete this page. |5.
   Select the sanctions based on the DWR policy and your discussion with
   the department chair. Then, scroll down to complete this page.|
6. Complete this page by writing a detailed summary of the case that
   includes the fact that you had a conference with the student to
   discuss their plagiarism. Also you should almost always mark Yes to
   “provide relevant supporting materials” for the case, and include
   appropriate materials such as the following:

-  a PDF of the SafeAssign report (if it shows passages plagiarized),
-  a screenshot of online resources plagiarized,
-  a screenshot of passages from the student’s essay that are
   plagiarized,
-  your course Syllabus showing your Plagiarism policy,
-  the essay assignment sheet |6. Complete this page by writing a
   detailed summary of the case that includes the fact that you had a
   conference with the student to discuss their plagiarism.|

Once you have completed this page, you will receive an automated email
saying the case has been initiated and giving you a Case number. The
student will then receive an email explaining that the case has been
filed, will be reviewed, and that s/he has 14 days to file an appeal. If
the student appeals, the Instructor may not even know, as usually the
plagiarism is too obvious/blatant to be adequately appealed. Therefore,
in most cases the Committee does not involve the Instructor any more
after initiating the case. The Instructor will simply receive an email
in 2-4 weeks time stating the Committee’s decision—which is almost
always to uphold the sanctions suggested by the Instructor. If any more
information is needed to help the Committee better understand the case,
the Committee would email the Instructor, but again, usually these cases
are decided quite quickly and with very little demand on the
Instructor’s time.

Below are some generic content to use when emailing a student whose
plagiarism is worthy of being reported:

*--Email content when initiating a plagiarism case with the Academic
Discipline Committee:*

Dear Student,

I have consulted with my department's chair about your case of
plagiarism in Essay \_\_\_, and he agrees with my assessment that parts
of your \_\_\_\_\_\_ essay contain instances of plagiarism. As you can
see from my Plagiarism Policy in the Syllabus, my department has set the
penalties for such writing as failure the paper and the course, and I am
required to make a report of this to the university's Academic
Discipline Committee. Do not fear that this report will damage your
academic career too terribly: it will not—as long as you learn how to
properly integrate research and never commit this type of plagiarism
again in other classes at UM. The Committee will likely only uphold the
penalties (or sanctions) that I recommend, which are failure of the
paper and the course. I will not recommend anything more severe than
this—not academic probation nor suspension—so do not fear the worst. The
Committee keeps a private database of the names of students it finds
guilty of plagiarism, but the purpose of this temporary database is only
in case you plagiarize a second time. This database information is not
shared anywhere else. Your parents/guardians are not informed since it
will not be reported on any public record in any way.

You will be contacted in a few days by this Committee asking if you
accept the sanctions or if you want to try and appeal them. Please
understand that if you accept these sanctions, your work in this course
will now be complete, and you will need to retake the course next
semester. If you choose to appeal, you will have to present a full case
to the Committee including evidence that all the ideas/writing in the
paper were either your original ideas or properly cited research.

*--Information if the student emails asking about options regarding
appealing the case and whether s/he should continue completing the
course work while the Committee considers the case:*

Dear Student,

You are now able to start an appeal process if you so choose, and you
have 14 days for this appeal process before the Committee makes a
ruling. You should have seen that Appeal option via the e-mail from the
Committee. You can simply follow the instructions in that email.

As for continuing to complete course work, any student reported for
plagiarism is always welcome to continue participating in the course
under the theory that you have paid for the experience, even if you
potentially may no longer pass the course. And you should definitely
keep doing course work until the case process is completed, which is
about two weeks if you appeal, or whenever you receive the Committee’s
decision via e-mail. You are welcome to discuss your case with my
department chair Dr. Robert Cummings whose email is cummings@olemiss.edu
or 662-915-1989.

[expand title="Adding Students After the Add Date/Waitlisted Students"
tag="h4"]

The waitlist policy for online courses is the same as traditional W&R
courses. The 23-student course cap is firm, and students can only be
enrolled in a course from the wait list if a spot opens up in the
course. The main difference is that allowing a waitlisted student to
attend your class unofficially until a spot opens up, as you might do in
a f2f class, is more complicated online. Though an instructor can add
students manually to a Blackboard course, if they are not on the
official roll, they will be dropped from the course when Blackboard
syncs with SAP overnight. So, what is the best practice for dealing with
these waitlisted students? Generally, we recommend that students seek
out another section. There is usually at least one open spot in an
online section of each of the three courses. It’s a good idea to remind
students that our courses follow standardized curricula, and that their
experience in each section of a given course is likely to be similar. If
there are no open sections, explain to the student the policy and share
with them the syllabus and any documents, readings, or materials that
you can email to them for the current week. We do not recommend enrolled
waitlisted students into your Blackboard section until they are
officially on the roll.

Adding students to an online course after the official Last Day to Add
can be risky and should be done in consultation with the department
chair. Adding students even as late as the second week comes with risks,
as their orientation to the online format and organization can take
several days. I find that students need the first two weeks to adapt to
the course organization in Blackboard, and if they miss these, they risk
feeling overwhelmed and discouraged from engaging at a high level. I
contact all students who fail to post any assignment during the first or
second week, and I let them know that they need to invest time not only
in completing the orientation assignments but in navigating the course
and getting comfortable with the format. Taking each late add request on
a case-by case basis--with advice from the department chair--is
important, and I also base my decisions on the quality of communications
I receive from the student, any previous writing work completed (either
in previous semesters or in current), and how the students responds to
the several assignments that I pick for them to make up.

**Adding Students Manually to a Blackboard Course**

Blackboard and SAP/MyOleMiss sync each night. If a student is added to
your roll and you want him/her to have access to the course immediately,
you can add the student manually to Blackboard.

[expand title="Course Design and Structure/Student Preview Mode"
tag="h4"]

Effective course design follows the principles of Universal Design and
User-Centered Design. That means that your course design should
specifically address the needs and challenges of student users. In most
cases, these design principles emphasize a simple, minimalist layout and
an organization for a course that is intuitive.

You may have an inclination to overwork the interface of your course by
adding redundant links, putting information in multiple places, and
essentially trying to anticipate every possible student path through
your content. We think you should resist that temptation: minimalist
interfaces that do not overwhelm users with information are key to
student success in an online course.

Here are some basic recommendations you can follow to keep your course
simple:

-  Put all of learning content in one place, and organize it by week or
   unit
-  Use an "About the Course" content area for syllabus content
-  Put all external resources and links in one content area
-  Use a numbering or naming system for your discussion forums,
   journals, and blogs that aligns to weeks, units, or lessons
-  Don't over-explain: For example, don't use a video recording to
   explain something that easily fits into a paragraph of text
-  Use basic formatting and styling for your text. Use CSS-styles when
   editing text (Heading 1, Heading 2, Subtitle, Quotation, etc) instead
   of hard-coded styling (bold, italic, underline). This not only makes
   your text more accessible, but it is cleaner and more consistent
   across different parts of your course. |screen capture of diaglog box

You can audit your design by putting yourself in a student’s shoes.
Blackboard’s Student Preview function makes this easier than before.

[expand title="Accessibility and Universal Design" tag="h4"]

Accessibility is a core value for the Department of Writing and Rhetoric
and for the university, and it’s something that we as online writing
teachers think is an essential part of our mission. We rely on the
principles of universal design to govern how we make our courses
accessible.

Universal design is really best demonstrated by the automatic door: an
automatic door is better than a standard door because people with
mobility limitations can access it. However, it is *also* better than a
standard door for everyone else: if you’re carrying boxes, for example,
you would prefer an automatic door. The same principle can be applied to
curb cuts, typography on signs, and the design of an online course.

There are a few things you should do to ensure that your course is
accessible to everyone who may be a participant in it.

-  Caption video content. Any video that you use in an online course
   must be closed captioned (at the very least, you must provide a
   transcript). Captions are a great example of universal design.
   Obviously they are essential for deaf or hard of hearing students,
   but are also useful for students who are visual learners or who may
   be watching your videos in a library or otherwise-quiet space. Closed
   captioning of videos is much less of a headache than it was just a
   few years ago:

   -  YouTube captioning is easy and fast. You can upload a transcript
      and convert it to closed captions or you can transcribe the video
      yourself using the built-in tools. YouTube’s automatic captions
      are unreliable unless you have a crisp, Midwestern NPR accent. For
      instructions, visit the Google help pages for YouTube:
      https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en
   -  The University provides a captioning service free of charge to
      online instructors. For more information, contact the Office of
      Online Design and eLearning, or fill out this form:
      http://elearning.olemiss.edu/captioning-service-available-for-onlinehybrid-courses-at-ole-miss/.
      Keep in mind that if your videos are short (as we think they
      should be), it would probably be faster and easier for you to
      caption the videos yourself.

-  Try to make your video instructions as universal as possible.
   Basically, instead of saying “Click here” and pointing to something
   with the cursor, say exactly what students should click on. Even if a
   video is properly transcribed, “click here” does not mean anything to
   a student who can’t see where “here” is. Also, if a non-visually
   impaired student is reading the transcript because that is his/her
   learning style, more specific instructions would help immensely.
-  Any PDFs you include in your course should be processed for screen
   reader accessibility. This is usually only an issue for scanned PDFs.
   For more information about making PDFs more accessible, visit the
   WebAIM guide on PDFs: http://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/acrobat
-  Be conscious of color and other style elements that may cause
   problems for people who may see things differently than you do. A
   good rule of thumb: boring, monochromatic color choices and
   typography are a safe bet. Don’t make your design an obstacle. For
   help with colors, a great tool is: http://www.colorhexa.com/
-  Remember that plain text is the most accessible mode of content
   delivery. Always ask yourself if your use of other modes is necessary
   or appropriate for your rhetorical purpose. For example: if you have
   an announcement to make, ask yourself if it makes sense to record it
   as a video as opposed to sending it as an email. Sometimes the answer
   will be “yes,” but often the simpler approach to communication is the
   better approach.

[/expand]

[expand title="Submission File Types" tag="h4"]

Because Blackboard only accepts certain types of files, it’s important
to make students aware of these limitations and set clear guidelines for
acceptable submission formats. You’ll want to include language in your
syllabus about this, and it’s also a good idea to cover this issue in
the syllabus quiz to reinforce this knowledge. You might also include
reminders about this in your instructions when students submit major
assignments. Lastly, you might consider penalizing inappropriate file
submissions as late work, since they often won’t open. *Sample Syllabus
Language regarding File Types* All work for this course should be
submitted in .doc, .docx, or .pdf format, as only these formats are
compatible with Blackboard’s grading interface. If you use a Mac and
compose files in Pages, please note that you must convert those files to
one of the acceptable file formats before submitting. Work submitted
with an inappropriate file extension may be penalized as late if the
instructor is unable to access it. [/expand]

[expand title="Using In-Line Commenting and Grading" tag="h4"]

The in-line commenting and grading feature in the current version of
Blackboard is an essential tool for online teachers. Instead of
downloading student essays, marking them up in Word, and reuploading
them to Blackboard, instructors can now leave comments directly on
student papers inside of Blackboard, post comments, and enter grades,
all from one screen. You can find Blackboard's tutorial video for online
grading below. Here are some things we have learned about the in-line
grading feature and how well it works in writing courses:

-  Be conscious of the time-out feature. The inline editor times out
   after 60 minutes, so if you are in the middle of marking up a paper
   and you get up to do something else, make sure you click "Save Draft"
   and exit the in-line editor. You can come back to it later and pick
   up where you left off. If you leave the editor up and come back to it
   after an hour, any markup you attempt to add will not "stick." This
   can also become and issue if you have a sketchy internet connection.
   Your best bet: Click "Save as draft" often just to be safe. |Save
   Draft feature of inline editor|
-  If you want to leave styled comments, or use video/audio comments,
   click the "A" underneath "Feedback to Learner." You'll have the full
   Blackboard content editor in a popup window.
-  If you're using a laptop, you might find the work area very small.
   Click the expand full screen button to give yourself more room
   |button to expand inline editor to full screen mode|
-  Use "Grading Notes" to leave notes to yourself about the paper. These
   aren't visible to the student, and can be really useful if you're
   going to conference with a student later.
-  The grade center column for the assignment must be visible to
   students in order for them to see your feedback. If you want to
   release all your feedback at once, hide the column from student view,
   complete your feedback, then unhide the column.
-  Students can access your feedback from two places:

   -  Go back to the original assignment link where the essay was
      submitted. Once the feedback is released, the comments and grade
      will show up. Until then, the paper the student actually submitted
      will show up (so they can always check to make sure that their
      submission "went through" correctly.
   -  Go to My Grades and click on the actual graded item (the drawback
      to this method is that they can see the grade here without
      actually reading the comments.

[iframe width="640" height="360"
src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YrMVXAx94Xc?rel=0"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen]

-  You must leave some kind of grade in order for feedback to be visible
   to students. This can be tricky when you're leaving feedback on
   drafts. The best rule of thumb here is to be consistent. If points
   for drafts aren't a part of your grading scheme, make sure that
   students know that if they see "100/100" as the grade for their
   draft, it just means that they submitted it and you commented on it,
   not that they actually received an A+.
-  "Point Comments" work most consistently. Some of the other markup
   tools are more frustrating.
-  The in-line editor accepts most common file types (PDF, Doc, Docx,
   RTF), but *not* .pages files. See the section on file type naming for
   more tips about this.

[expand title="Using Blackboard Rubrics" tag="h4"]

Blackboard Rubrics can be a great tool for online teachers, and can
making the grading process much more efficient. Though they are very
easy to use for grading, they are challenging to create, especially if
you want them to work the same way as the standard W&R rubrics. In
addition to the Blackboard tutorial video below, we have a few
suggestions for you if you want to use Blackboard rubrics, and we have
provided templates for several rubrics that you can import directly into
Blackboard if you want to use them.

-  There are five different types of rubrics: No points, Points, Point
   Range, Percent, and Percent Range. Obviously, the easiest to use is
   "No Points," but obviously that option doesn't calculate anything for
   you. In our experience "Point Range" and "Percent Range" are the best
   options, as they allow for more flexibility in terms of exact
   calculations. Otherwise, you may find it frustrating that the
   rubric's calculation of a grade doesn't align with the grade you had
   in mind. |types of rubrics in Bb|
-  Make sure your students know you use rubrics, and that you are making
   them visible. When you apply a rubric to an assignment, you have four
   different display options. By default, rubrics are **not** visible to
   students. "After Grading" means that students cannot view the rubric
   until you have released grades. "Yes (Without Rubric Scores" may be
   the best option if you find that the rubric calculations don't always
   line up with what you want. That way, students can see rubric
   feedback, but not the exact point distribution. They see the score
   you enter manually only. |Rubric display options|
-  Don't leave end-comments inside the rubric. Students are less likely
   to look at the rubric because it's an extra click. The best place to
   leave feedback is in the "Feedback to Learner" box on the main
   in-line grading page. The "Feedback to Learner" box inside the rubric
   is only visible to students under certain conditions. |rubric

We have created several rubrics that you can import into Blackboard
directly. Feel free to use these as they are or edit them to match what
you'd like to see in a rubric. To import a rubric, just go to the
Rubrics area under "Course Tools" and click "Import." You can upload the
ZIP file directly (don't decompress it).

[expand title="Self and Peer Assessment: Pros and Cons" tag="h4"]

After using this tool with three different semesters, here are some pros
and cons to consider. If you have a class where 90% of the students are
participating consistently, then this is a great tool. I heard from Exit
Surveys that many students felt their Peer Reviews were helpful. I do
not have to read and manually score them myself. However, if you have
more than about ten students who are **not** posting work on time, then
this tool causes the following problems: 1) the Blackboard system has
total control over the random pairing of students, so some participating
students will be paired with non-participating students. You have to
resolve this issue by Viewing Submissions and emailing students to try
and match them with others in their situation. I had to create a Word
doc with all the Evaluation questions and email it to these students so
they could fill it out outside of Blackboard. This was just to make sure
they got to practice giving feedback. They would still (hopefully)
receive feedback IF the student assigned their Submission participated
in the Evaluation. 2) This leads to the second problem:
non-participating students failing to fill out the Evaluations. In the
directions, I had to specify that students needed to email me if their
draft received no Evaluations--then I would usually fill out the Word
doc Eval myself for their draft :( 3) Also, some participating students
would not give adequate feedback. Since I do not have to go through and
read all the Evaluations, I would be unaware of this UNLESS a student
emailed me to complain. Then I would go into the system, read the
feedback, and change their score accordingly.

In this part of the guide, we list contact information for important
people and offices across campus, and describe what they can do for you.
If you are teaching writing from a distance, you might find it
frustrating to try to figure out who to contact for different things:

Since 2010, writing courses at the University of Mississippi have
emphasized reflection, revision, and transfer of knowledge.

The Reflection Blog, or Commonplace Book, asks students to engage in
frequent, diverse, and sustained reflection over the course of the
first-year writing experience. Students use their blogs as a space to
collect and unpack ideas. Through the different types of composition in
the Reflection Blog, students will develop a more sophisticated
understanding of what it means to be an academic writer and they will
cultivate an "academic identity" as they move beyond their general
education experience.

Welcome to our guide to teaching online writing courses through the
Department of Rhetoric at the University of Mississippi. We—a group of
writing instructors who have taught WRIT 101, 102, and 250 online—have
collaborated to bring you all of the best practices we could think of
for teaching writing online here at UM. We hope to update this guide on
a semester-by-semester basis in order to keep up with curriculum
developments in our WRIT courses, as well as the constantly changing
terrain of online resources we have gathered for our students.

This guide is designed to help teachers acclimate to the unique
challenges of teaching rhetoric and composition online. Designed by
instructors currently teaching writing online for the Department for
Writing and Rhetoric, this guide includes brief course tours, course
policy advice (i.e. how to keep office hours online, how to conference
with students, how to construct a welcome video, etc.), links to videos
explaining how to effectively use Blackboard, and sample assignments
(including prompts, rubrics, lectures, and homework assignments).
Although the guide is comprehensive, it also includes contact
information to help you solicit further help or advice if necessary.

While online courses afford flexibility that the traditional classroom
might not, we also understand the importance of standardizing our
courses in order to ensure that students get a consistent experience
throughout their time in our writing sequence. Thus, while this guide
introduces plenty of optional material for you to choose from, this
guide also complies with the curricula standardized by the University of
Mississippi Department of Writing and Rhetoric. We have taken every
effort to ensure that our guide includes standardized syllabus language,
policies, and assignment sequences in accordance with DWR guidelines.

We believe that teaching writing online can offer not only all of the
rigor of a face-to-face course, but also new opportunities—new ways of
writing—that students in a traditional classroom would never have the
opportunity to experience.

This guide is broken into three parts. The first part contains our
philosophies for teaching online and an annotated bibliography of
critical scholarly sources that have influenced our teaching. All of
these sources are available through the UM library’s databases, but you
can always contact any of the authors for a copy of a source.

The second part of our guide reviews some of the most important
concepts, policies, and processes for teaching writing online. We tried
to write this section with the perspective of a new online writing
teacher in mind.

The third part of the guide contains contact information for people in
the department and throughout the university who can answer questions
you have, teaching

This section of the OWI Resource Guide is designed to give you
pedagogical and theoretical perspectives from experienced UM online
writing teachers. Here you will find a selection of teaching philosophy
statements and advice summaries from each teacher. We have also
assembled an annotated bibliography of sources related to OWI that have
been influential in our own teaching.

In Their Own Words: Excerpts from OWI Teacher Philosophy Statements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Each of the experienced online teachers who have worked on the OWI
Resource Guide shared excerpts from their teaching philosophy statements
related to their work online.

[expand title="Keith Boran" tag="h4"]

At times, I did not feel like I was doing a good job being their
teacher, but one email changed that helpless feeling I had been living
with. One of my students, one whose writing needed vast improvement for
college, emailed me to thank me for my feedback on his essay. He wrote:
“[I] have never felt so good about writing my entire life. [T]hank you
for helping me understand it better. I wish I knew about rhetoric in
high school, it[‘]s so helpful.” This was a student who was struggling,
one that I was concerned about because he was in an online course and
not doing terribly well, but he was learning. He was not afraid to try,
to learn, or to solicit constructive criticism; he was becoming a
writer. As his confidence grew, so did mine. I knew that I could still
be an effective teacher, even if I never met my students face to face.
We were a community.

This is not to say that I’ve figured this online teaching thing out, or
that I now have all the answers. I still have a lot to learn about being
an effective online instructor, particularly when it comes to such a
subjective subject like writing. But just like my student said about his
learning last semester, I feel good about my transitioning to teaching
online. And this student, along with my other students last semester,
helped me understand how to do my job better, how to be a teacher. I am
grateful to them for helping me learn to be real in a virtual classroom.

[expand title="Sheena Boran" tag="h4"]

*Be available … but not too available:*

As an instructor who always wants to be available, I’ve had to learn to
manage the guilt that accompanies not being “there” when a student needs
help. Because online learning (at least the asynchronous kind) allows
students some freedom to complete work at their leisure, many of my
students, for a variety of reasons, work on their assignments late at
night, when they sometimes have questions that would benefit from
immediate answers. I’ve accepted that I can’t always be available when
students need me, but I still struggle with guilt when I read panicky
emails in the morning. I also struggle with the few cases where my
availability has created “monsters.” For example, so far this semester,
I’ve had 120 separate email exchanges (conversation threads, not
individual emails) with one student in WRIT 250. I’m concerned that this
particular student has become too reliant on constant email
communication with me. Each time I check email (and I check quite
frequently), I’ve received an average of two messages from her, often
just a few minutes apart. I’m really struggling to convince her that she
doesn’t need this constant feedback and that it would be better to
produce a product and seek suggestions for revision than to try to use
email to address concerns in real time as she’s working. This is not a
problem I’ve solved yet; it’s not a problem I’ve ever encountered
before. I know there’s a balance here that I need to strike; I’m just
not sure where it lies, or even which side of it I’m on right now.

*Provide tools for success … and make sure students can access them:*

Last semester a few students expressed frustration that they only had
access to what was due during the current week and asked for a full
course schedule. The irony, of course, is that there was a full course
schedule available to them in the Information tab on Blackboard. But
because they didn’t know or remember how to find it, it may as well have
not existed. I experienced a similar problem last semester with feedback
on student work. I always provide detailed marginal comments on major
assignments, and those comments always contain advice to students for
future essays. As it turns out, though, a number of my students didn’t
know how to return to their attempts in order to view my marginal
comments on their essays. So again, because they couldn’t access it, all
that individualized instruction may as well have not existed.

I’m still working through strategies to deal with these access issues,
but one major change this semester is that I’ve posted a video tutorial
that shows students how to access feedback on their essays. This has
helped somewhat, but it’s clear that some students still aren’t
accessing their feedback. For example, one student in WRIT 250 emailed
to ask if I’d read his whole paper. When I opened his attempt in
Blackboard to see what kind of feedback I had given him on the
assignment, I scrolled through my marginal comments on his draft. They
went all the way to the last paragraph. But because he didn’t see them,
he didn’t benefit from them on the next assignment and didn’t understand
his grade. I’m still struggling to determine whether issues like this
one stem from the actual difficulty of accessing resources on Blackboard
or from a lack of investment in the course, but my instinct says that a
combination of those factors is at play here. [/expand]

[expand title="Tom Bullington" tag="h4"]

Let students choose their goal.

At the beginning of the semester, I ask my students to select one of our
course outcomes on the syllabus as their writerly goal for the semester.
I ask students to explain what this goal means to them, why they chose
it, and what are some of the concrete ways in which they can work on
this goal in their own writing. For each of our major assignments, I ask
my students to reflect on their progress towards this goal: how far have
they come, and whether they need to change from one goal to another.
Thus, with the ePortfolio at the end of the semester, I ask my students
to take their initial goal and expand it into their reflective
introduction.

This technique does more than merely centering the course on the
ePortfolio: I've found that, when I ask my students to select their own
goal as a writer, the course becomes less about fulfilling a requirement
and more about their own writing. Small steps like this can make a
student take ownership of their own work, and, hopefully, find something
to take with them outside of this course—something greater than a mere
grade. Small steps like this can also make the online course feel more
intimate, more customized to each student's individual experience.

The principle behind this technique applies to any class regardless of
format, but in online classes this technique assumes the special meaning
of making a student's experience feel individual, particularly when I as
an instructor take note of each student's chosen goal, and use that goal
as my theme for their feedback. Thus, whenever I begin writing my
summative remarks on a student's paper, I'll begin with the formula of
“You chose \_\_\_\_\_ for your goal this semester, so I'll gear all my
feedback towards that goal.” Giving students the sense that they have
chosen their own feedback helps them take more ownership of their work.

[expand title="Dixon Bynum" tag="h4"]

Years ago, when online teaching and I were younger, I eschewed the
opportunity to take an overload course online. Frankly, I had an
attitude: the virtual classroom, I rationalized, couldn’t possibly be a
viable substitute for the face-to-face experience. I relied heavily on
chalk-and-talk and a large presence in the classroom; I often joked that
teaching was a contact sport.

Ten years later, an old dog with nearly two decades in the profession,
I’m teaching strictly online and after some reflection, I’ve decided
that my mantra is, “Keep it simple.” Now that doesn’t infer a refusal to
incorporate newer technology into the virtual classroom—I’m always
looking for ways to make my courses more productive for my students—but
I’ve found that an emphasis on simplicity in course design and
presentation is essential. After several different experiments with
course construction, I’ve settled on a week-by-week skeleton in which I
include repeated and dependable elements. That, I suppose, is the most
common translation of my mantra in practice: dependability. As I’m not
“there” physically to clear up any confusion for my students every two
or three days, I want my students to enter a dependable space each time
they encounter a new lesson during the semester. A dependable and simple
structure also reassures non-traditional students (especially older,
place-bound students) who need to utilize online instruction to continue
their education. Finally, an emphasis on clean, dependable course
construction helps the old dog teachers like me—those still a little
skeptical—go slowly and incorporate only the best of options for our
students.

[expand title="Jane Gardner" tag="h4"]

Full disclosure: This Fall 2015 will be my first time to fully teach
online. I have used Blackboard for in-class teaching, but teaching
online is challenging. I’m not only teaching online for the first time
but, I am teaching Writ 250 -- a first timer. So I can only share my
teaching philosophy up to this point and that involves creating my class
online to Blackboard. My suggestion to future online teachers is to
begin early especially if you’ve never before taught the course.

Secondly, ask other online teachers to give you access to their classes
online on Blackboard. I have found this latter suggestion to be
invaluable. Everyone has his or her own style and I’ve picked up
pointers from all of the online teachers.

Thirdly, if you’ve used Blackboard previously for your regular in-class
classes and you have a certain way you create your assignments and
deliverables then do that also with your online course. You can change
it next semester after you are feeling more comfortable with the whole
online teaching phenomenon.

Fourthly, be precise and concise with your Blackboard course design. One
of our veteran online instructors places everything under “Content” and
says the more you add to your Blackboard panels the more confusing it is
to the students. I am still learning this concept, and I think with
practice and experience, I will improve. Precision I have learned from
using Blackboard in my face-to-face classes is important. English is not
the first language of many of our students, and every step you
articulate on Blackboard is taken at face value. You cannot assume any
point or step is obvious.

Lastly, I hope you are reading our W&R Online Best Practices Guide and
that it is offering the guidance you need to navigate the online
frontier.

Engaging students through multiple platforms was a revelation to me ten
years ago, and the daily challenge of it has kept my teaching fresh and
appealing to students’ different styles of learning. Online learning
comes with its own set of obstacles in keeping students engaged, but I
strive to teach a variety of texts—from online magazine articles, blogs,
video advertisements, and speeches—each one showcasing a different
rhetorical form. This practice of presenting information in a variety of
formats appeals to students’ diverse learning styles: readings from the
textbooks, short videos, still images, narrated PowerPoint lectures,
links to online articles, humorous memes, and group activities using LMS
tools. Though I cannot replicate my presence in the physical classroom,
the online environment creates innovative avenues for interaction with
students—almost all requiring some form of writing and thus requiring
that students actually write more for an online class. Furthermore, my
online course design allows me to offer individual feedback on several
steps of the Writing Process—an invaluable practice that I could not do
in the face-to-face classroom. Below I break down some of the best
practices of Online Writing Instruction and show some examples of how my
courses fulfill them.

1. Good practices in course design
2. Innovative use of technologies that transcend traditional classroom
   instruction and engage students
3. Commitment to providing a quality education to students

How to “be there” when you aren’t there: establishing presence and ethos in the online writing class
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While email does allow for instant communication in an online course,
the online environment can provide other means of being “there” for
students, means that go beyond the email communication of traditional
face-to-face classes. Here are some techniques that we have found useful
for reaching our students when they need more than a standard email:

-  Apps such as Google Hangouts and Skype tend to work fairly well for
   conferencing with students, but we’ve had the best experience with
   Zoom. Zoom allows instructors to start a meeting with a student by
   sending that student a link to the meeting via email. Students don’t
   need to set up Zoom accounts; as long as the instructor has the
   student’s email address and an account of her own, the meeting link
   will work. Zoom meetings can only last about 40 minutes at a time, so
   this time limit allows student conferences to be more focused, and to
   fit more easily into busy schedules. (For more conferencing apps, see
   “Conferencing with Online Students” and “Office Hours” below.)

-  During your office hours, log on to whichever conferencing app you’ve
   chosen. If you’ve chosen Skype or Google Hangouts, any students
   logged into these apps will see that you’re available. Even if they
   choose not to contact you during that time, your visibility sends an
   important message.

-  Offer multiple conferencing apps if you can. Both Skype and Zoom, for
   instance, or both Google Hangouts and Zoom--and remain logged into
   these apps during your office hours. Some students might already have
   accounts with one app or another, so offering a range of meeting
   platforms makes it easier for students to contact you.

-  Regardless of which conferencing app you use, it’s best to turn the
   camera off after the first few minutes of the meeting and go strictly
   with audio. This practice respects student privacy better than using
   both audio and video the whole time. Students often have to squeeze
   in their conferences with their online instructors at odd places and
   times: between classes, at food courts, shopping, or often in their
   own dorms. If a student is in a private space such as a dorm room,
   it’s best to respect their privacy by switching off the video after
   the first few minutes of the meeting. Let students know why you’re
   turning off the video when you do so, and briefly explain that this
   is your standard policy for online conferences: “I think it’s best
   for us just to go with audio for this conference, if that’s alright
   with you. It’s a bit less awkward that way.” Many students feel more
   comfortable with this approach, since it’s a gesture that shows that
   you’re aware of the awkwardness online meetings sometimes pose.

-  If your teaching style involves posting weekly announcements, don’t
   simply email these announcements as text (see “Students who are MIA”
   below for more information on Monday announcements). Instead, try
   making a YouTube video of just you narrating the announcements to
   your students. Often, these announcements merely reiterate what
   students can find on their weekly schedule or in the syllabus, but
   having this kind of weekly reminder can help students stay on task,
   and help keep your face and voice in a very text-heavy environment.
   You can post links to your YouTube video directly in the course and
   email it to students. Pair your link to the YouTube announcements
   with a bullet-point synopsis, and use YouTube’s closed captioning
   feature (see “Accessibility and Universal Design” below). Pairing
   text with video helps keep this content accessible.

-  If a student emails you with a persistent problem, question, or
   issue, invite them to set up a conference with you, and do so
   repeatedly. Even if students don’t take you up on this offer--and
   many tend not to--make it clear that they are welcome to do so. This
   is the equivalent of keeping your door open during office hours; it
   also sends the message that, within the time you’ve set aside to
   teach the class, students are welcome to come meet with you. Not
   extending this welcome repeatedly and actively can make an online
   instructor seem aloof and distant.

-  And, of course, make it clear when students can’t contact you. If you
   tell students from the first week that you won’t be able to respond
   quickly or at all on weekends, most students will be understanding
   and respectful of this boundary. However, you might want to consider
   setting aside some late afternoon or evening times during the
   weekdays, since these times tend to be the most available for online
   students. Students are often taking online courses because their
   schedules are otherwise full. While the boundaries on your time need
   to be clearly stated, a little flexibility can go a long way.

While teaching online precludes the possibility of being physically
present for most students, techniques such as those outlined above can
help establish the ethos of a face-to-face instructor, while offering a
scheduling flexibility that the traditional classroom might lack.

Course Design
-------------

Writing 250 is designed to continue the learning trajectory students
begin in Writing 100/101 and Writing 102. The overall goal of this
course is to strengthen the writing and research skills introduced in
first-year composition classes so that students can conduct
well-organized and -designed research in their major. Writing 250
assignments emphasize documenting sources, maintaining an online
portfolio, and analyzing real research results. Students also create a
digital presentation in order to gain experience using digital composing
tools for writing and presentation.

Assignment Sequence
-------------------

Beginning in Spring 2014, all sections of Writing 250 were standardized
to include the following assignments: 1) exploratory essay; 2) annotated
bibliography; 3) literature review; 4) prospectus; 5) multimodal
presentation, and 6) eportfolio final reflection/analysis essay.
Classwork, homework, and process writing assignments are distributed
through the ePortfolio in a "Research Toolbox" section.

Major Projects
--------------

Students compose six major projects. Assignments 2 through 5 comprise a
large-scale research project. Students will be working with the same
topic for the majority of the semester. A brief overview of each
project, with a description of the areas students usually struggle with,
is provided below. (Click the arrow next to the project title to
expand).

[expand title="Exploratory Essay" tag="h4"]

The Exploratory Essay is designed to introduce students to writing in
the disciplines and to finding/using Library resources related to their
major. This narrative essay requires students to find and compare
academic and non-academic sources on the same topic. There are three
variations of the assignment that instructors can choose from. The final
product takes the form of a process narrative in which students trace
their steps in finding and comparing sources. Usually, the exploratory
essay ends up generating a topic idea that students will want to pursue
for the subsequent assignments.

Areas to highlight: Students often struggle with understanding the
difference between academic journals themselves and the articles within
them. This can be particularly difficult in online sections of the
class. It is also important to walk students through Library database
searches (or request a librarian demonstration), as students sometimes
assume that any source that comes from a library search is
peer-reviewed. Also, sometimes students make this first assignment more
complicated than it needs to be: it's ultimately a process narrative,
and instructors should emphasize that it's a relatively low-stakes
entry-point into researched writing in the disciplines.

[/expand]

[expand title="Annotated Bibliography" tag="h4"]

The second major assignment is an annotated bibliography based on
secondary research for the research project students have identified.
Students will articulate a topic and rationale in a topic proposal
ePortfolio/Research Toolbox assignment around the same time as they are
working on the annotated bibliography. For the annotated bibliography,
students select 8 to 10 academic or professional research sources and
write summaries and evaluations of each source. Students also write an
introduction to the bibliography, in which they identify trends or
concepts that connect the sources to one another.

Areas to highlight: Students often struggle with selecting good sources,
even though they have already had experience with the process with the
exploratory essay. Some of the same issues are prevalent, including the
use of popular/non-academic sources, as well as sources published in
academic journals that aren't necessarily appropriate for a literature
review (opinion pieces, book reviews, etc). Students also struggle with
meaningful, detailed summary and specific evaluation of the sources, and
sometimes tend to review the sources in very broad terms.

[/expand]

[expand title="Literature Review" tag="h4"]

The literature review is a synthesis of secondary research on a
student's topic. Students choose at least five of their secondary
sources from the annotated bibliography to include in a literature
review that describes the "state of research" in their major on their
chosen topic. Emphasis is placed on identifying the gap in existing
research, into which the student's proposed research project will
eventually fit.

Areas to highlight: Students struggle with synthesis of sources and
identifying gaps in research. Also, sometimes students have trouble
seeing "the big picture" of research, and instead more through their
sources in isolation. It's important to emphasize the balance between
direct quotation, paraphrase, and original synthesis, as sometimes
students rely too heavily on direct quotation.

[/expand]

[expand title="Prospectus/Research Study Design" tag="h4"]

The Prospectus is the culmination of the research project students have
worked on for the entire semester. The prospectus serves as a formal
proposal for an original primary research project in the student's
major, based on the research question identified earlier in the
semester. In the prospectus, the students combine a condensation of the
literature review with a discussion of the results of their small-scale
primary research project (mini-pilot or in-class survey), and outline an
original study that they have designed to answer their research
question.

Areas to highlight: It helps to describe the prospectus as a sales
pitch. Students should think of it as an opportunity to "sell" their
proposed research project to a group of skeptical colleagues.
Ultimately, they have to prove that they have credibility as researchers
in their field and that their project is valid enough to stand on its
own. The effectiveness of this approach depends largely on how well
students can show how their original student fits into the discourse
community established in their review of literature.

[/expand]

[expand title="Multimodal Presentation" tag="h4"]

Students work on the multimodal presentation concurrently with the
prospectus. The presentation is the student's opportunity to "sell" the
research project proposed in the prospectus. Students are required to
use different modes of expression in assembling the presentation,
including video, audio, and handouts. In a face-to-face class,
presentations usually take place during the last week of the semester.
In an online class, students create recorded versions of their
presentation and share on a discussion board. In the Spring Semester,
instructors have the option of requiring participation in the
`Celebration of Student
Writing <http://rhetoric.wp.olemiss.edu/celebration/>`__ in lieu of the
in-class presentation.

Areas to Highlight: Students often don’t recognize that a change in mode
or medium requires a change in technique, so students need help in
understanding how electronic, visual, or spoken text is different from
print text and, thus, how to think about audience. Students may also
need help with unfamiliar technology. Students also struggle with making
their presentation persuasive (selling their proposed research) instead
of informative (reviewing existing research).

[/expand]

[expand title="ePortfolio/Research Toolbox Reflection" tag="h4"] The
final ePortfolio/Research Toolbox reflection asks students to look back
on the writing and research they have compiled throughout the semester,
and identify a course outcome in which they believe they have shown as
much growth. Students must also compare the artifact(s) they use to
identify the outcome to one of their scholarly sources in order to show
how their writing and research is similar to (or differs from) scholarly
writing that is published in their field.

Areas to highlight: Students are generally unfamiliar with
self-reflection and metacognition and need many opportunities throughout
the semester to practice. Some students struggle to limit the discussion
in the ePortfolio reflections to one outcome and one project. Many will
need help with being more specific about their learning. Students should
demonstrate their progress, or lack thereof, through examples and by
showing, not telling.

[/expand]

Research Toolbox/ePortfolio
---------------------------

Most Writing 250 teachers agree that regular in-class writing, group
work, and emphasis on process help students succeed in the course. The
committee has developed numerous activities and smaller assignments,
called the Research Toolbox, which correspond to the major writing
assignments for the course. These are low-stakes classwork and homework
assignments that instructors can feel free to modify or rework to suit
the needs of their own classes.

Grading
-------

Rubrics for each project are available on the DWR Document Library.
Sharing the rubric with students at the beginning of each unit, and
using the rubric to determine the project’s final grade, helps students
understand the expectations for each project and the reasons for the
final grade. Using the rubric to determine grades also provides
consistency across sections of DWR courses. Projects should be graded
and returned within one week of submission.

In this part of the guide, we share words of advice, reflection, and
encouragement from the teachers who piloted the commonplace book
curriculum in 2016.

[expand title="Daily Writes: The Road is Long with Many a Winding Turn
(Karen Forgette)" tag="h3"]

The Bowling Green State University Center for Teaching and Learning has
a great
`handout <https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/center-for-faculty-excellence/TLG_PDF/TLG_Reflection.pdf>`__
on teaching students to reflect. That handout provides a list of bullet
points delineating the hallmarks of good reflection, including:

-  Evidence of serious thinking and questioning
-  Self-awareness and honesty
-  Concrete and specific examples
-  The ability to show relationships between prior and new knowledge

When I see evidence of these hallmarks in my students’ commonplace
books, I know they are moving into reflection territory. However, they
journey through a lot of barren, flat landscape before reaching the
Promised Land. Reflection, like all ways of knowing or habits of mind,
takes practice and time.

*Exhibit A*
^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the reasons the DWR shifted from the ePortfolio model to the
Commonplace Book model was to give students more opportunities to
practice reflection. The daily writes are an integral part of that
practice. Early daily writes tend to be summaries of class, like this
one:

    Today in our group discussions on The New York Times, I learned how
    other people maneuver the page and find articles that interested
    them. The other students that were in my group said that they
    decided on their topic mainly by what was appearing more frequently
    on the home page.  My group also liked to write about things that
    dealt with them, including their religious beliefs or their home
    town.

This student is giving reflection a shot.  He is describing what we did
in class that day and trying to frame it within the larger context of
his learning, but mostly, he’s just recapping what he did.

But that was September.  By November, here’s what that same student’s
daily writes looked like:

    Today in class we had to listen to several other multimodal
    projects. I can honestly say that after listening to about fifteen
    seconds of other pieces, I could tell how awful mine truly was. Once
    again I was witness to the writing rule that your first draft is
    pretty much absolute crap and so are the next five or six tries. I
    also learned that I wrote my script filled with evidence, which
    would be great if my audience were forty five year old high school
    teachers that desperately want to see evidence. Sadly, that's not my
    audience. I learned that I have to make this script more
    interesting, and can possibly do so by taking away some facts and
    evidence and putting them into the project visually instead of
    audibly. I can guarantee that two days from now my script will be
    nothing like it is now.

Here the student moves beyond summarizing what happened in class to
analyzing what he learned in class and considering how that learning
fits into the larger scheme of his writing knowledge.  He links his
prior learning (writing is a process, audience awareness) with his
current practice and devises a plan for improving his project.    In
terms of the hallmarks of good reflection, he takes his learning
seriously, demonstrates self-awareness, provides concrete examples, and
establishes connections.

*The Takeaway*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So how did he get there?  He practiced (daily writes, weekly writes, and
unit reflections).  He paid attention to feedback (mine, his
classmates’, models of good reflection, and his own consideration of his
commonplace book).    He took ownership.  By recording and thinking
about what he was learning, he started to build his own intellectual
framework for how he operates as a writer.

Reflection is a long and winding road, as this student’s work
illustrates, but, as John Dewey said, “We do not learn from experience,
we learn from reflecting on experience.”  The more practice our students
have in reflection, the more they will learn.

[expand title="Taking Advantage of Ritualistic Reflection – A Comment on
Daily Writes (Amber Nichols-Buckley)" tag="h3"]

I am a Writing Project teacher. So beginning class with a writing prompt
has always been a natural part of my pedagogy. Since most of my teaching
experience has been at the high school level, I’ve always had ample time
for daily writing. But shifting to a college composition course with
three 50-minute classes per week made it more and more difficult to get
that daily writing done.

Enter the 2014-15 academic year and my work on the commonplace book
pilot. When I started using the commonplace book last year, I wasn’t
sure what the end result should really be. I knew I wanted to be a part
of the pilot because it emphasized the importance of frequent
reflection, and my hope was that students would reflect more
authentically than I had seen them do previously. I also felt that the
daily write portion of the commonplace book would force me to make time
for reflection, which is essential to our students’ growth as writers,
sure, but more importantly, as academics.

I realized quickly, though, that reflection is a difficult concept for
our novice writers. And I realized that I struggled to teach it. Many
daily writes seemed shallow, and a part of this was that students were
rushed to finish them. In a 50-minute course, expect that most daily
writes will be 3-5 minutes max. And expect that some days, you just
won’t fit it in at all.

To help combat some of these issues, I brought it to the table at one of
our pilot meetings. Karen Forgette shared some reflection terms from
Kathy Yancey that truly resonated with me. Those are: Reflection in
Action, Constructive Reflection, and Reflection for Presentation (you
can read more about this in `her
e-book <http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/usupress_pubs/120/>`__). I
realized pretty quickly that daily writes are very much “Reflection in
Action,” which is loosely defined as composition that is written as an
explanation to others for the purpose of understanding an event better
ourselves.

Daily writes are, at their core, “summaries” of the day. Often, I would
prompt students to write about where they were in their process. Here is
an example student response:

    *“I have no process at the moment. Right now I am just trying to get
    my life together. Something that I have been working on is preparing
    my mind mentally for this research paper. I am completely not even
    here today which is really unfortunate. But I think that I am going
    to do my paper on family dynamics. I was really into the essay about
    technology helping family relationships and not necessarily hurting
    them. I want to go somewhere in that direction.”*

Sometimes, I would allow the daily write to be a venting sesh on what
was going on in their worlds. We played with other prompts as well, such
as “#hashtagtheclass” or “Today’s class got me like…” I would try to
bring in common phrasing from social media because this helped students
understand their audience for daily writes, which is ultimately
themselves. Here are some favorite hashtags:

    -  .. rubric:: todaywasreallyHELPFUL!
          :name: todaywasreallyhelpful

    -  .. rubric:: thestruggleisreal
          :name: thestruggleisreal

    -  .. rubric:: needmorerhetoricalstrategies
          :name: needmorerhetoricalstrategies

    -  .. rubric:: ethosgameonehunna
          :name: ethosgameonehunna

    -  .. rubric:: shouldawrittenthat
          :name: shouldawrittenthat

    -  .. rubric:: OhThatsDueToday?!?!
          :name: ohthatsduetoday

    -  .. rubric:: PrayForAnA
          :name: prayforana

    -  .. rubric:: gottagetmyshitstraight
          :name: gottagetmyshitstraight

    -  .. rubric:: workthatprocess
          :name: workthatprocess

In fact, #workthatprocess became like a class motto for students last
year, and “#hashtag the class” really became one of our favorite go-to
prompts, especially when we were pressed for time.

Not only do daily writes help students reflect as ritual, but they are
so helpful for the teacher. I never realized how much I would come to
depend on daily writes for my own formative assessment. I could tell
when students “got it” or when they were utterly confused. I could tell
when they felt overwhelmed. I understood when remediation was needed. In
fact, on those days when I just couldn’t fit a daily write into the day,
I missed them. I almost felt like, “How do I plan for the next class
without a daily write?”

Ultimately, the daily writes served as good mini-reflections that would
end up feeding into stronger, more authentic reflections (weekly writes,
sometimes…unit reflections…often, end of semester final reflections,
definitely). And to be honest, students’ later daily writes were places
where I feel like I saw the truest glimpses into their writing voices.
I’m not sure if it was because the daily writes were so low-stakes
(ungraded) or because they were so short. Whatever the reason, the daily
writes proved integral to helping students enter a deeper layer of
reflection, what Yancey calls “Constructive Reflection” (which is
essentially reflecting on prior reflections…reflections that are
cumulative in nature).

Expect that, at first, students will be writing their daily writes for
you more than anything. With time, as you get to know them better, and
as they get to know each other better (and, God-willing, get to know
themselves better), you will notice their daily writes becoming more
personal and authentic. And you’ll see this feed into their larger
reflections as well.

[/expand]

[expand title="Commonplace Book: Expectations vs. Reality (Colleen
Thorndike)" tag="h3"]

Daily Writes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Be flexible with when you give the daily write prompt: you could start
class with it by having them reflect on the previous class or on their
homework; you could toss out the daily write prompt in the middle of
class as they’re transitioning from one activity to another; and, of
course, you can have them write it at the end. Changing up when they do
the daily write keeps them on their toes and they are more likely to
have quality posts.

Don’t be afraid to get creative and have fun with the daily prompts.
Some of my favorites have been silly ones. Here are three daily write
prompts and examples from student blogs:

**PROMPT**: What hashtag(s) would you use to describe today’s class and
why?

    .. rubric:: whenInDoubtWriteItOut
       :name: whenindoubtwriteitout

    I only had fragments of a working thesis and some scatterbrained
    paragraphs walking into today’s class and I decided to just “brain
    dump” my topic and it turned into a darn good working thesis. The
    power point helped a lot too, I will definitely be pulling up those
    slides when I’m working later.

**PROMPT**: 5 words to describe today’s class

-  Tiring
-  Helpful
-  Slightly irritating
-  Interesting
-  Insightful

**PROMPT:** Use pics/gifs to complete: This weather and the end of the
semester got me like…

|1| |2| |3|

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Each of these examples from different students’ blogs show different
levels of reflection, but highlight student engagement with the
Commonplace book space. The last example is not reflective of the class
itself, but of the student’s mindset at the time (this was during a week
of almost nonstop rain towards the end of the semester). This was a
daily write I did because so many students were just tired and stressed
and burnt out, so they needed a jolt of fun to snap out of the rain and
end of the semester induced funk.

Overall blog
^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the first meeting of the pilot group for this project, I had a
few concerns about the commonplace book. It seemed really great and
exciting, but I was worried about how students would react to it and my
first thought was “How am I going to read and grade ALL of these things
for FOUR classes?” It was an overwhelming task that I thought I would
have to do every week. However, once the semester started and we met and
discussed expectations of students and of instructors, we all began to
realize that it would be nearly impossible to grade these daily and
weekly writes and this reflective space isn’t about grades at all. It’s
about letting students take ownership of their learning and work out how
to write meaningful reflection.

While I don’t grade each and every daily write and weekly write, I read
through them fairly quickly each day---I think of the daily writes as a
barometer for student understanding and progress. It’s a really
wonderful way to assess what students are struggling with in a certain
unit and when they really understand it, their posts show this.

It’s best not to mention grades or points or anything when it comes to
the Commonplace book until the end of the semester when they are doing
the final reflection and reading back through to tag and organize their
posts. By de-emphasizing grades/points when you talk about the
Commonplace, students should stop obsessing about them. In the fall
semester I had more students obsess and ask about points/grades with the
Commonplace (in 100/101) than in the spring—by 102 they just accepted it
as a weird thing they had to do everyday in class and that was it.

My best advice for dealing with students who obsessively ask about how
it will be graded or what their grade is on it, is to tell them that the
grade is on the final product, but in order to have a final product they
need to work on it all semester. Making them accountable for doing the
daily and weekly writes is part of the process of the Commonplace.

I was worried about students buying into this idea and doing all of
these posts. Some students won’t do every post, a few will not do most
posts, but the majority of students will post their daily writes without
much grief. I’ve had more problems with students doing the weekly
writes—they would forget about them since it was an out of class
assignment. To combat this, I started doing Connect 10s once a week in
class; I’d start class with a prompt asking students to make connections
with something we had been working on in class and things outside of
class—this could be how they write differently in different classes or
coming up with a list of “writing rules”. I give students 10 minutes or
so to write and then we spend some time talking about their responses
before moving on to another class activity. Students have the option of
adding to their posts later that day if they want or they can just post
what they wrote in 10 minutes. These Connect 10s, which are based on
James Lang’s Small Teaching ideas, changed weekly writes—students
actually did them and they added great conversation and reflection to
those class days.

Most students find the Campuspress platform really easy to use—they just
have to log in with their UM id and password and they immediately have a
blog with a pre-set template. Then they just have to join your class (if
you choose to run yours as a class blog—I highly recommend this). They
can post easily—just clicking the + icon on their homepage. I add a link
to the Campuspress log-in page to my class’s Blackboard page, just so
that my students don’t have to remember the website or constantly ask
me. It helps to walk them through the posting process a couple times,
but they quickly get the hang of it.

At the beginning of the semester, students may be confused about what
goes on their blogs and what goes on Blackboard. I always tell my
students that the blog is their space for their informal writing and
Blackboard is for formal writing. I emphasize that informal writing is
not graded and formal writing is graded. So the blog is reflections and
informal posts and Blackboard is formal papers.

[/expand]

[expand title="One Woman’s Perspective on the CPB (Jenny Jackson)"
tag="h3"]

I adore the Commonplace Book, and if you were to mention the CPB to me
in passing, you would be stuck listening to me sing its praises
(seriously, feel free to ask me about it). The Wordpress platform is
easy to navigate and use and the possibility for students to make their
CPBs their own (through theme and design) within Wordpress is more than
there.

While there is so much to say about how useful and effective the
Commonplace book has been for my classes the past two semesters as a
space for collecting writing and reflecting upon their work and
experiences both inside and outside of the writing classroom (and how
useful I believe it will continue to be), what I want to emphasize here
to instructors who are about to complete the CPB for the first time is
that it can also be fun. Yes, actual fun in the writing classroom.
Teacher fun and student fun!

One of the best memories I have from class last semester was brought on
by a CPB activity thought up collaboratively with my lovely teaching
circle. The activity prompted students to make a list of “the top five
ways to survive the end of the semester” using only GIFs and to post
these lists to the class blog instead of their personal blogs. My
students and I were cracking up at GIFs of dogs running in circles or
babies making faces at their parents, whatever they found to represent
their stress and stress-relief tactics. It was the perfect activity to
break up the tension of the end of the semester and to remind students
to breathe, laugh, and relate to each other.

Yes, the CPB has proven to be to be a great space for students and
classes to collect writing and reflection in an organized and manageable
way. However, the CPB is also just fun to use and offers opportunities
to shake the typical classroom goings-on up a little. That’s what I
really love.

difficulties of assigning and assessing reflective writing.

The common reading book selection is used each year in EDHE 105/305
courses primarily as a framework for class discussions, projects, and
writing assignments that explore social themes and/or issues from the
book. EDHE 105/305 instructors use the text (with a focus on those
themes and issues) to teach students how to explore their personal
reactions, to understand and appreciate both the things that make them
different from their peers and the things that they have in common, and
to effectively and respectfully voice their own opinions and viewpoints.

--------------

Note to teachers: It is recommended that before asking your students to
speak publicly or participate in projects where they may have to
directly address their own health backgrounds you assign a simple
writing or journal prompt asking students to describe what health and/or
healthcare looks like or means to them personally. Answers from students
will hopefully guide you in covering the common read material in a
manner that won’t cause anxiety or other possible issues for some
students.

The Commonplace Book is situated with the CCCC Position Statement on
the Principles and Practices in Electronic Portfolios:

*Principle #6: Integration and Curriculum Connections*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Students link artifacts in a flexible structure that (1) synthesizes
diverse evidence and ideas, (2) invites linear or non-linear ways to
read and evaluate e-portfolios, and (3) makes connections to
portfolio-related evidence and relationships distributed across the
Internet. Students may therefore use linking to represent how
e-portfolio artifacts inter-relate with other courses in the larger
context of whole-curriculum learning.*

Why a commonplace book?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The commonplace book integrates the role of ePortfolio into the daily
and weekly coursework of WRIT 100/101 as well as providing an
opportunity for students to identify and articulate connections among
 ePortfolio artifacts.   Like the standard WRIT 100/101 ePortfolio, this
project incorporates unit reflections on major projects, but the
commonplace book expands the scope of the ePortfolio to include daily
quickwrites and weekly classical rhetorical exercises.  In this way, the
project becomes an ongoing “writer’s gym” or “writer’s workbook” that
students access every class period.  In daily quickwrites, students
respond for 1-2 minutes to a creative or reflective prompt.  In weekly
progymnasmata, students complete sequenced exercises focusing on
specific rhetorical strategies.    In the final two weeks of the
semester, students create categories that articulate their learning and
tag each entry in the commonplace book with one or more of those
categories, using the tags to identify connections among the diverse
artifacts.  

Commonplace Books and Blogging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The electronic space that most closely mirrors the classical commonplace
book is a blog. Blogs are ultimately organized chronologically, the same
way that a bound commonplace notebook would be, but the added
classification features of categories and tags allow for dynamic
organization of compositions. Commonplace as Blog also encourages
student agency and ownership of design, organization, and purpose in
physical terms as well as in conceptual terms. Another useful comparison
is Commonplace as Pinterest for text. Though the visual design metaphor
for Pinterest is less applicable, the notion that users construct
meaning, set goals, and work through problems on the Pinterest platform
is similar to what we are asking them to do in the Commonplace.

The first-semester, first-year writing courses—WRIT 100 and WRIT 101—use
the Common Reading Text as the basis for a major writing project.
First-year writing courses use the Common Reading Text as a basis for
student reading and writing rather than as a literary study.

The second major assignment is an annotated bibliography based on
secondary research for the research project students have identified.
Students will articulate a topic and rationale in a topic proposal
ePortfolio/Research Toolbox assignment around the same time as they are
working on the annotated bibliography. For the annotated bibliography,
students select 8 to 10 academic or professional research sources and
write summaries and evaluations of each source. Students also write an
introduction to the bibliography, in which they identify trends or
concepts that connect the sources to one another.

Areas to highlight: Students often struggle with selecting good sources,
even though they have already had experience with the process with the
exploratory essay. Some of the same issues are prevalent, including the
use of popular/non-academic sources, as well as sources published in
academic journals that aren’t necessarily appropriate for a literature
review (opinion pieces, book reviews, etc). Students also struggle with
meaningful, detailed summary and specific evaluation of the sources, and
sometimes tend to review the sources in very broad terms.

The DWR Teaching Policy directory contains all policies related to
teaching Writing and Speech classes at the University of Mississippi.
Some of these policies include passages that should be included verbatim
in each syllabus; in other instances there are suggestions for how
teachers should address particular issues. In every case, these policies
are supported by the Chair, Assistant Chair, and the Core Faculty, who
are available to handle questions and provide further interpretations.

The purpose of these policies and procedures is to improve the teaching
and learning of writing and speech, and in the event of any ambiguity,
decisions should be made in light of this common goal.

The Exploratory Essay is designed to introduce students to writing in
the disciplines and to finding/using Library resources related to their
major. This narrative essay requires students to find and compare
academic and non-academic sources on the same topic. There are three
variations of the assignment that instructors can choose from. The final
product takes the form of a process narrative in which students trace
their steps in finding and comparing sources. Usually, the exploratory
essay ends up generating a topic idea that students will want to pursue
for the subsequent assignments.

Areas to highlight: Students often struggle with understanding the
difference between academic journals themselves and the articles within
them. This can be particularly difficult in online sections of the
class. It is also important to walk students through Library database
searches (or request a librarian demonstration), as students sometimes
assume that any source that comes from a library search is
peer-reviewed. Also, sometimes students make this first assignment more
complicated than it needs to be: it’s ultimately a process narrative,
and instructors should emphasize that it’s a relatively low-stakes
entry-point into researched writing in the disciplines.

The literature review is a synthesis of secondary research on a
student’s topic. Students choose at least five of their secondary
sources from the annotated bibliography to include in a literature
review that describes the “state of research” in their major on their
chosen topic. Emphasis is placed on identifying the gap in existing
research, into which the student’s proposed research project will
eventually fit.

Areas to highlight: Students struggle with synthesis of sources and
identifying gaps in research. Also, sometimes students have trouble
seeing “the big picture” of research, and instead more through their
sources in isolation. It’s important to emphasize the balance between
direct quotation, paraphrase, and original synthesis, as sometimes
students rely too heavily on direct quotation.

Students work on the multimodal presentation concurrently with the
prospectus. The presentation is the student’s opportunity to “sell” the
research project proposed in the prospectus. Students are required to
use different modes of expression in assembling the presentation,
including video, audio, and handouts. In a face-to-face class,
presentations usually take place during the last week of the semester.
In an online class, students create recorded versions of their
presentation and share on a discussion board.

Areas to Highlight: Students often don’t recognize that a change in mode
or medium requires a change in technique, so students need help in
understanding how electronic, visual, or spoken text is different from
print text and, thus, how to think about audience. Students may also
need help with unfamiliar technology. Students also struggle with making
their presentation persuasive (selling their proposed research) instead
of informative (reviewing existing research).

[forthcoming]

[expand title="Instructor Promotion Policy" tag="h3"]

Titles for Instructor Track
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The College of Liberal Arts policy specifies three levels for the
Instructor track: Instructor, Lecturer, and Senior Lecturer. The
Department of Writing and Rhetoric will follow the outline implied by
this policy, e.g., Instructor of Composition and Rhetoric, Lecturer of
Composition and Rhetoric, and Senior Lecturer of Composition and
Rhetoric. However, in certain cases, DWR positions have more
individualized variations to the title of Instructor, including “Core
Instructor.” In these cases, the individualized variations will be
combined with the Lecturer and Senior Lecturer nomenclature to yield:
Core Instructor, Core Lecturer, and Senior Core Lecturer.

Appointment
^^^^^^^^^^^

Persons appointed to a 1.0 FTE Instructor positions, with a numbered
line and permanent funding sources, begin accruing service counted
toward time in rank at the date of hire within the Center for Writing
and Rhetoric. Additionally, candidates may ask to apply years of
continuous full-time service in tenure track lines from other
institutions at the time of appointment, provided that the candidate,
upon application, holds the position from which the tenure track service
was accrued. Service in temporarily funded lines, or from full-time
positions within other departments within the University, will not apply
toward time in rank in DWR positions. Any requests to apply service from
other positions must be awarded at the time of appointment to DWR
positions or foregone. In any case, no more than three years of prior
service will be applied to a DWR position.

Positions which come to the DWR through consolidation with other units
within the University will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

Rights, Privileges, and Responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instructional faculty are the foundation of the Center for Writing and
Rhetoric. They perform the essential functions of teaching writing and
speech at all levels, facilitating the teaching of writing, speech, and
literacy skills in all curricula, and promoting the identity of the
discipline of rhetoric and composition in the campus community. Further,
they share in the decision making in almost all aspects of their jobs,
including designing curricula, advising students, providing professional
development of fellow teachers, conducting personnel searches, and
reviewing teaching effectiveness. In keeping with CLA policy,
instructional faculty do not participate in tenure and promotion
decisions of professorial faculty nor the review of academic
administrators.

Although instructional faculty members are not eligible for tenure,
individuals holding the rank of Lecturer or Senior Lecturer cannot be
terminated without a minimum of twelve month’s notice. Exceptions could
be made under extraordinary circumstances as follows: 1. Financial
exigencies as declared by the Board of Trustees; 2. Termination or
reduction of programs, academic or administrative units as approved by
the Board of Trustees; 3. Malfeasance, inefficiency or contumacious
conduct; 4. For Cause.

Promotion to Lecturer or Senior Lecturer is accompanied by a permanent
salary increase. The amount of salary increase is determined at the time
of promotion.

Promotion Procedure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Time in Rank** – The general requirement is that one should serve five
years in the rank of Instructor before being considered for promotion to
the rank of Lecturer, and serve six years in the rank of Lecturer before
being considered for promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer. Five/six
years in rank shall be defined as five/six years of service for which
Instructor Activity Reports and Administrative Evaluations are available
for review. The faculty member will thus be considered for promotion
from instructor to lecturer during his or her sixth year of service, and
the promotion will become effective at the beginning of the seventh
year. Similarly, the faculty member will thus be considered for
promotion to Senior Lecturer during his or her seventh year of service
as Lecturer, and the promotion will become effective at the beginning of
the eighth year.

When instructors or lecturers are ready for promotion, they will prepare
a dossier documenting evidence of having met the requirements listed
below.

**Teaching** – Teaching effectiveness shall be the principal criterion
for promotion. Consequently, evidence to support a record of teaching
effectiveness should be systematic, comprehensive, and thorough. A
portfolio documenting this effectiveness must include the following
essential elements:

-  Student evaluations of all courses taught during the period of
   review.
-  Structured classroom observations by DWR peer faculty and TDG
   leaders.
-  Documents for each course taught, including a recent syllabus,
   samples of recent assignments, online resources if appropriate, and
   grade distributions.
-  Copies of annual DWR reviews.
-  Documentation of activities designed to maintain currency in the
   discipline and in pedagogy (see the criteria pertaining to
   scholarship).

**Scholarship** – Scholarship activity will be considered favorably as a
part of the promotion dossier. Evidence of active scholarship would
include the publication or presentation of academic papers at the local
or regional level in either the discipline or in pedagogy. Instructors
do have an obligation to remain informed of current scholarship in their
discipline and in the scholarship of teaching in higher education. Any
application for promotion must demonstrate that the applicant sustains
knowledge of developments in the discipline and in the related areas of
pedagogy.

**Service** – Instructors are expected to be active in service to their
discipline, academic departments, the College of Liberal Arts, the
University, and to their students. Such service may be documented
through participation in professional organizations, departmental and
university committees, advising, or other academic support activities.

Promotion Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to be promoted from Instructor to Lecturer, and then Lecturer
to Senior Lecturer, instructional faculty must perform duties beyond
teaching alone. However, since instructional faculty do typically teach
a full-time teaching load of 4/4 during the regular term, any duties
beyond classroom teaching should both (1) sustain and improve classroom
teaching, and (2) be defined so as to not create an overly burdensome
additional workload.

Criteria for promotion include teaching, scholarship, and service. Each
category of service is ranked by reviewers as either (1) adequate, (2)
excellent, or (3) superior.

In order to qualify for any promotion, faculty must achieve the rank of
superior in teaching, and adequate in scholarship and service. The
guidelines below will serve to assist both applicants and reviewers in
establishing mutual expectations. The time period under consideration is
all years of service since hiring or the last promotion.

The procedure established for the review of tenure and promotion
dossiers for tenure-track faculty provides a generally satisfactory
model for the review of instructional faculty. Some important exceptions
are as follows:

-  The Dean of the Graduate School and the VC for ORSP do not
   participate in the review.
-  The DWR review and vote will be from a panel of five full-time DWR
   faculty, appointed by the Chair of the DWR.
-  An unsuccessful application for promotion does not prejudice later
   applications; in fact, evidence of addressing deficits identified by
   the review panel shall be considered in a positive light in
   subsequent applications.
-  Letters from outside evaluators are not required.

**Composition of the Review Panel**

Applications promotion will be reviewed first by a review panel
established by the Chair of the Center for Writing and Rhetoric,
consisting of five DWR teaching faculty who, when possible, hold
appointments more senior than the candidate.

**Review Schedule**

The timetable for the presentation and review of the promotion dossier
shall be as follows:

-  Notification to the DWR Chair of application for promotion – February
   21, 2014
-  Completed dossier presented to the Review Panel – March 14, 2014
-  Recommendation of Review Panel presented to DWR Chair – April 4, 2014
-  DWR Chair recommendation to the Dean, College of Liberal Arts – April
   11, 2014
-  Dean’s recommendation to the Provost – April 25, 2014
-  Provost’s decision – May 9, 2014

At each stage in the process, the candidate will be notified of the
recommendation or decision.

[expand title="Tenure-Track Promotion Policy" tag="h3"] The Department
of Writing and Rhetoric (DWR) offers the following tenure policy in
order to support faculty in the mission of creating original,
peer-reviewed knowledge and contributing to the full range of university
research, service, and governance.

Distribution of the professional responsibilities of DWR faculty is:
Research 40%, Teaching 40%, and Service 20%.

Tenure
~~~~~~

Research (40%)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The research production goal of the tenure track is to achieve a
national or international reputation for creating peer-reviewed original
knowledge advancing the fields of Writing Studies or Speech
Communication. The accomplishments which indicate satisfaction of
expectations toward tenure are categorized below. Candidates may choose
from the following research activities to reach 100% of the research
expectation:

a. a sole-authored, peer-reviewed book published by an academic press on
   a topic relating to writing studies or speech communication
   (satisfies 100% of expectation);

b. a collaborative, peer-reviewed book published by an academic press on
   topics relating to writing studies or speech communication (a single
   work satisfies 40% of expectation);

c. a sole-authored, peer-reviewed, volume published by an academic press
   on topics relating to writing studies or speech communication, which
   candidate edits and within which candidate publishes his or her own
   sole-authored work (a single work satisfies 40% of expectation);

d. a collaborative, peer-reviewed, volume published by an academic press
   on topics relating to writing studies or speech communication, which
   candidate co-edits and within which candidate publishes his or her
   own sole-authored work (a single work satisfies 40% of expectation);

e. a sole-authored, peer-reviewed, journal article (from MLA-indexed)
   journals with a rejection rate of at least 50% (a single work
   satisfies 20% of expectation);

f. a collaborative, peer-reviewed, journal article from MLA-indexed
   journals with a rejection rate of at least 50% (a single work
   satisfies 10% of expectation);

g. a sole-authored, peer-reviewed chapter placed in an edited collection
   published by an academic press on topics relating to writing studies
   or speech communication(a single work satisfies 20% of expectation);

h. a collaborative, peer-reviewed chapter placed in an edited collection
   published by an academic press on topics relating to writing studies
   or speech communication(a single work satisfies 10% of expectation);

For tenure a combination of the elements above totaling 100% of workload
expectation will constitute superior research.

Also important are oral presentations, including the delivery of
conference papers and lectures, as well as the presentation of
workshops. But in the assessment of achievement in this area quality of
research and publication are the overriding criteria.

In addition, candidates for tenure must exhibit a potential for ongoing
research and an established long-term commitment to research which
exhibits a promise of significant publications.

The fulfillment of research expectations shall be adjudged, primarily,
by the chair of the department, the members of the department already
tenured, or appointed members of the departmental tenure and promotion
committee, with a minimum of four external letters of evaluation
solicited from scholars of national repute who did not have a conflict
of interest with the candidate as defined by University policy. At least
two of the four external evaluators will be chosen by the chair in
consultation with the other tenured faculty in the department, or
members of the departmental tenure and promotion committee, and the
chair will make every effort to select at least one letter from a list
of four to five candidates provided by the faculty member being
considered for tenure. Candidates for tenure shall provide copies of all
relevant publications to the department and shall list in their tenure
dossier all other relevant research activities. In the case that a work
to be considered is not yet in print, a letter from an editor stating
that publication is imminent shall be required.

Teaching (40%)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Of primary importance is the quality of one’s teaching. Good teaching is
expected and inadequate performance in teaching may constitute grounds
for denial of tenure. However, excellent teaching alone is insufficient
for recommending tenure. Among items relating to performance which shall
be considered in this area, both quantitatively and qualitatively, are
the number and variety of courses taught; the direction/coordination of
courses; thesis and dissertation committee work; direction of courses
offered in an independent study mode; development of new/revision of
existing courses/instructional materials; textbooks authored; teaching
awards; and applying for and/or obtaining of grants for pedagogical
improvements or program development.

The fulfillment of teaching expectations shall be adjudged, primarily,
by the chair of the department and the members of the department already
tenured, or appointed members of the departmental tenure and promotion
committee, on an inspection of the teaching portfolio component of the
candidate’s tenure dossier. The chair of the department reviews
student-reported, peer-reported, and self-reported data on the
candidate’s teaching within the annual review portfolio during yearly
review sessions. Strong candidates for tenure regularly meet courses
with little or no interruption, regularly return student assignments
with formative and summative feedback within approximately one week,
complete mid-term and final grades in timely manner, meet promptly with
students when requested, maintain recommended office hours, offer
conferences with students no less than once per semester, record grade
distributions which do not commonly award “A” or “F” range for the
majority of students, participate in teaching portfolio process on an
annual basis, receive positive annual teaching evaluations from peers
and students, and document a practice of sustained reflection for
teaching and demonstrate those habits and actions through a teaching
portfolio presented to the chair as part of annual review.

Service (20%)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this area, among the items which will be evaluated are international,
national, regional, state, and local committee/task force work, workshop
participation, professional evaluation of work (e.g., external review of
tenure/promotion dossiers, external review of manuscripts for
publication, book reviews); organizing/chairing/serving as discussant
for conference panels, advising of student organizations, service on
editorial boards, work as an officer in professional organizations,
consulting, student advising, university and departmental recruitment,
administrative work, and community service. The fulfillment of service
expectations shall be adjudged, primarily, by the chair of the
department and the members of the department already tenured, or
appointed members of the departmental tenure and promotion committee,
based on information on the above activities provided in the candidate’s
tenure dossier. Failure to perform adequate service may constitute cause
to deny tenure; however, exceptional service alone does not constitute a
sufficient basis for recommending tenure.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

The department is responsible for informing candidates of these
standards and the process for applying for tenure, for collecting and
maintaining necessary materials, for selecting committee participants,
and for scheduling all needed meetings. The department requires annual
reviews of all faculty. Credit for prior time in service and/or
accomplishments in a tenure-track position, or for other accomplishments
in a field of practice, must be explicitly defined, acknowledged, and
awarded in writing at the time of the offer of a position; no credits
for accomplishments or time in service in other positions will be
awarded after the offer of position is accepted.

Issues not explicitly addressed by this policy, including but not
limited to definitions of titles, descriptions of process, and
definitions rights and responsibilities of tenure track faculty, are
defined elsewhere by University Policy.

This tenure policy may be amended by a successful vote of the Department
of Writing and Rhetoric tenured faculty and subsequent approval by the
College and University.

--------------

The Department of Writing and Rhetoric (DWR) offers the following
promotion policy in order to support faculty in the mission of creating
original, peer-reviewed knowledge and contributing to the full range of
university research, service, and governance.

Distribution of the professional responsibilities of DWR faculty is:
Research 40%, Teaching 40%, and Service 20%.

Promotion to Associate Professor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Candidates who satisfy departmental expectations for tenure shall also
be considered promotable to associate professor.

Promotion to Professor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since promotion to professor demonstrates the highest professional
achievement in the University community, associate professors must show
that they are mature and dedicated faculty members and demonstrate a
sustained record of achievement in all three areas of the profession in
order to be promoted to the rank of professor. The evaluative criteria
for promotion to professor are the same as tenure, however, the
promotion review committee should identify and reward work of
increasingly greater impact on the field, expanding scholarly reputation
and prestige, after the candidate’s promotion to associate professor. In
addition, the committee should consider and reward the following
categories of achievement which, while not typical for assistant
professors, might be found in applicants for professor:

i. Grantmaking. Completed applications for grants related to research
   and/or pedagogy of writing studies or speech communication.
   Successful and unsuccessful proposals will satisfy this requirement,
   however, the review committee will be responsible for judging the
   potential impact on the discipline of both successful and
   un-successful grants.

j. Journal Editing. Service as peer-reviewer for scholarly journal
   focusing on writing studies or speech communication where service
   results in the national/international publication of at least two
   articles of not less than 10,000 words per calendar year.

The fulfillment of all three professional expectations shall be
adjudged, primarily, by the chair of the department and the members of
the department already promoted to the rank of professor, or appointed
members of the departmental tenure and promotion committee.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

The department is responsible for informing candidates of these
standards and the process for applying promotion, for collecting and
maintaining necessary materials, for selecting committee participants,
and for scheduling all needed meetings. The department requires annual
reviews of all faculty. Credit for prior time in service and/or
accomplishments in a tenure-track position, or for other accomplishments
in a field of practice, must be explicitly defined, acknowledged, and
awarded in writing at the time of the offer of a position; no credits
for accomplishments or time in service in other positions will be
awarded after the offer of position is accepted.

Issues not explicitly addressed by this policy, including but not
limited to definitions of titles, descriptions of process, and
definitions rights and responsibilities of tenure track faculty, are
defined elsewhere by University Policy.

This promotion policy may be amended by a successful vote of the
Department of Writing and Rhetoric tenured faculty and subsequent
approval by the College and University.

The Prospectus is the culmination of the research project students have
worked on for the entire semester. The prospectus serves as a formal
proposal for an original primary research project in the student’s
major, based on the research question identified earlier in the
semester. In the prospectus, the students combine a condensation of the
literature review with a discussion of the results of their small-scale
primary research project (mini-pilot or in-class survey), and outline an
original study that they have designed to answer their research
question.

Areas to highlight: It helps to describe the prospectus as a sales
pitch. Students should think of it as an opportunity to “sell” their
proposed research project to a group of skeptical colleagues.
Ultimately, they have to prove that they have credibility as researchers
in their field and that their project is valid enough to stand on its
own. The effectiveness of this approach depends largely on how well
students can show how their original student fits into the discourse
community established in their review of literature.

Most Writing 250 teachers agree that regular in-class writing, group
work, and emphasis on process help students succeed in the course. The
committee has developed numerous activities and smaller assignments,
called the Research Toolbox, which correspond to the major writing
assignments for the course. These are low-stakes classwork and homework
assignments that instructors can feel free to modify or rework to suit
the needs of their own classes. To view the Research Toolbox assignment
descriptions, visit the DWR Document Library.

Course Design
-------------

Writing 100/101 is designed as an introductory course to academic
writing featuring genres commonly used in other academic situations such
as analysis, argument, and reflection. Students choose to take either
Writing 100 or Writing 101 and then move into Writing 102 or Liberal
Arts 102 after successful completion of either course; they are not
placed into either course by test score or writing sample.

Suggested Assignment Sequence
-----------------------------

The suggested assignment sequence is as follows: Common Reading Text
project, Analysis, Argument, Multimodal, Commonplace Book. The Common
Reading Text project emphasizes the critical reading, critical thinking,
analysis, research, and synthesis skills that are vital to college
writing. This project is the ideal starting point because the assignment
is based on the Common Reading Text, which students are given over the
summer. With related campus events, the Common Reading Text can help
teachers establish a community of readers and writers. The next project,
the Analysis, helps students build the critical thinking skills they
need to write analytically in many of the other assignments, both in
Writing 100/101 and across the university. The Argument strengthens
students’ research skills by asking them to work with outside sources
and utilize the University library. The Multimodal project, which is a
sort of revision or rethinking of a previous paper, takes place later in
the semester. The Commonplace Book is an ongoing, semester-long project
that requires students to reflect on their learning and writing
practices.

--------------

Major Projects
--------------

Students are expected to complete five major units, each of which
comprises critical reading and response, a drafting process, and
reflection. In at least three of the units, students should be assigned
a short timed-writing exercise as part of the writing process. A brief
overview of each project, with a description of the areas students
usually struggle with, is provided below. (Click the arrow next to the
project title to expand).

[expand title="Common Reading Text Project" tag="h3"]

The Common Reading Text project emphasizes the critical reading,
critical thinking, analysis, research, and synthesis skills that are
vital to college writing. Students respond to one of the prompts
included in the annual Common Reading Resource Guide.

Areas to highlight: Some students may not have read or finished the
source text and will benefit from a pre-semester reminder to read the
book. They may have limited experience with reading/interpreting a
writing prompt. Students will have varied experience in analysis and
argument, and most will have little experience with synthesizing
texts/voices. Students may also not be familiar with extensive drafting
and the rigor of college expectations. The Common Reading Text Project
is roughly a two and one-half week unit.

[/expand]

[expand title="Analysis" tag="h3"]

In analysis, students examine an issue or an artifact’s component parts
to understand how it makes meaning. Analysis is roughly a three-week
unit.

Areas to highlight: Many students don’t have much experience with
analysis and often have difficulty moving past summary. Some are
unaccustomed to examining individual parts of an issue or an artifact
and may need guidance in breaking down the whole. Often, students
struggle with identifying an analytic thesis that answers the questions
how, why, and/or so what. Once students have a draft in place, the most
common problems are organization and focus. It is not uncommon for a
student to try to cover many different ideas. These writers need help
organizing their thoughts and focusing their essays. Students sometimes
struggle with providing enough specific evidence to support their
analyses. These writers may need to be alerted to areas that would
benefit from additional evidence.

[/expand]

[expand title="Argument" tag="h3"]

In argument, students make a claim and support that claim with evidence.
While instructors may assign for this project different types of
argument, the essay should require background information on the topic
as context for the argument, a clearly-expressed main claim, evidence,
and refutation of counter-arguments. Argument is roughly a four-week
unit.

Areas to highlight: Students often need help narrowing a topic to a
specific, debatable claim. Some students struggle to provide enough
specific evidence to support their claims and need help locating and
evaluating sources. Students often need help integrating quoted material
and paraphrases into their texts as well as documenting their sources.
Students may also need help considering opposing viewpoints or
counterarguments and refutation.

[/expand]

[expand title="Multimodal" tag="h3"]

In the multimodal assignment, students re-work or re-think an earlier
project in a different mode or medium. Multimodal is roughly a two-week
project.

Areas to highlight: Students often don’t recognize that a change in mode
or medium requires a change in technique, so they need help in
understanding how electronic, visual, or spoken text is different from
print text and, thus, how to think about audience. Students may also
need help with unfamiliar technology.

[/expand]

[expand title="Commonplace Book" tag="h3"] The commonplace book is a
personalized space for recording, organizing, and reflecting on a
student’s learning. This semester-long project incorporates daily,
weekly, and unit reflections, culminating in a final reflective post.

Areas to highlight: Students are generally unfamiliar with
self-reflection and metacognition and need many opportunities throughout
the semester to practice. Many will need help with being more specific
about their learning. Students may have difficulty demonstrating their
progress, or lack thereof, through examples, often resorting to more
telling than showing. Students may also struggle to understand how
tagging can be a mechanism to represent the larger structures of their
learning.

[/expand]

--------------

Grading
-------

Rubrics for each project are available on the assignment library.
Sharing the rubric with students at the beginning of each unit, and
using the rubric to determine the project’s final grade, helps students
understand the expectations for each project and the reasons for the
final grade. Using the rubric to determine grades also provides
consistency across sections of DWR courses. Projects should be graded
and returned within one week of submission.

Course Design
-------------

WRIT 102 (First-Year Writing II) is a theme-based, first-year,
second-semester writing course designed to build on writing skills
learned in either WRIT 100 or WRIT 101 and develop critical thinking and
research skills appropriate for use in academic writing. The course pays
special attention to developing argumentative skills, analyzing texts,
and synthesizing information into thoughtful, coherent essays and
projects.

The five themes are Business, Environment, Food, Pop Culture, and
Power/Privilege. Each theme will use different readings from different
textbooks, but the learning outcomes of the course and the assignments
remain the same. The prerequisite for WRIT 102 is the successful
completion (at least a D) in WRIT 100/101 or other similar course or AP
credit. Classes are limited to 21 students. WRIT 102 is similar to LIBA
102 in that both fulfill the same requirements for graduation; Students
will take either WRIT 102 or LIBA 102, but should not take both.

Each WRIT 102 instructor will be assigned a subject librarian who can
lead or assist instruction in using library services. WRIT 102
instructors should coordinate with this librarian by sharing assignments
and learning goals. It is courteous for instructors to stay with the
class during this instruction period. If instructors plan to miss class
during this library visit, they should arrange to have another W&R
instructor there. The librarians have also created `courses pages for
WRIT 102 <http://guides.lib.olemiss.edu/writ102?hs=a>`__ which can be
found here.

Instructors should hold at least one mandatory conference with students.
It is recommended that this is done during the research paper drafts.
Instructors may cancel classes to hold these conferences but
cancellations should be comparable to the number of courses one teaches
and should not extend beyond one week.

As is the case in every writing course, peer review and timely
instructor feedback are important to student success.

Assignment Sequence
-------------------

WRIT 102 has six major assignments in roughly this sequence: Analysis,
Synthesis, In-Class, Research, Multimodal, Commonplace Book. Each paper
assignment should teach fundamentals of academic writing, including
learning to find and evaluate sources, learning how to integrate and
cite these sources correctly, and learning how to create a unique thesis
in response to these sources.

`WRIT 102 Assignment
Library <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/alib/writ102/>`__

--------------

Major Projects
--------------

Students compose six major projects. A brief overview of each project,
with a description of the areas students usually struggle with, is
provided below.

[expand title="Analysis" tag="h3"]

Paper #1 is an analysis of a single text. This can be a response paper
to an author’s argument or a profile or analysis of a person, place, or
thing. It should be 3-4 pages with at least a single entry on the Works
Cited page and is worth 10-15% of the student’s final grade.

Areas to highlight: This assignment will help students learn to look
closely at a text (academic or otherwise) and begin the fundamentals of
quoting and citation. Because some students may have had a disruption in
time between a WRIT 100/101/equivalent course and a WRIT 102 course, it
is recommended that instructors go over thesis statements and paragraph
construction. Students may also need help in understanding the
difference between summary and analysis.

[/expand]

[expand title="Synthesis" tag="h3"]

Paper #2 is a synthesis paper where students weigh at least two
different arguments and synthesize a thesis in relation to these
arguments. The skills learned in the synthesis paper should support the
work done for the research paper. To that end, the WRIT 102 curriculum
committee has offered two different tracks for the synthesis paper in
the assignment library, with the recognition that these approaches are
not necessarily mutually exclusive. The first track practices locating,
evaluating, and synthesizing sources, and the second track, focuses on
developing a unique position in response to given texts. For either
track, students should engage with 2-3 sources and practice citation in
a 4-5 page paper. The Synthesis paper is worth 15-20% of the student’s
final grade.

This is probably the most difficult assignment in the WRIT 102 sequence.
Students are confused about what defines a synthesis essay because it
does not fit into familiar and practiced models of writing. The WRIT 102
committee, after lengthy discussions, essentially agrees with this
assessment because of our own divergent opinions. See the WRIT 102
synthesis in the assignment library for more information on this
discussion and the committee’s conclusion.

Areas to highlight: Instructors should go over plagiarism issues such as
correct citation and using paraphrases as well as other skills that will
help students succeed in the research paper. Students struggle with
balancing their sources; students may also have trouble maintaining
their writing voice in relation to the sources. If using two sources,
students may need help in avoiding a compare and contrast paper.

[/expand]

[expand title="In-Class Essay" tag="h3"]

The in-class essay is a timed writing exercise where students may do
similar work as in papers 1 and 2 in that students might be asked to
respond to a particular text or argument or evaluate a text’s argument.
This may be related to paper #3, the research paper. The in-class essay
is worth 5-10% of the student’s final grade.

Areas to highlight: Timed writing can be intimidating to many students.
Going over strategies to alleviate stress will be useful for this
assignment and for future timed writing situations. Further, students
may believe the writing process does not apply to timed essays but
instructors should model how to use brainstorming/outlining, drafting,
and revision in this context, with special attention to time management.
Students who do not do well in this assignment often do not prepare for
the in-class essay or do not read the prompt carefully. Instructors may
also opt for a practice timed essay in class. Students who need special
accommodation should provide the appropriate paperwork from `Student
Disability Services <http://sds.olemiss.edu/accomodations/>`__.

[/expand]

[expand title="Research Paper" tag="h3"]

Paper #3 is the research paper where students will develop a research
question relevant to the class theme. This paper should be 7-9 pages and
use at least seven credible sources. This assignment is worth 25% of the
student’s final grade.

Areas to highlight: This is the most intimidating assignment for
students. Many of them may have never written this length of paper. Some
may have only written an “informational” research paper and not an
argumentative one. Since the class spends nearly a month of class
periods on this assignment, the sequence of homework assignments,
in-class work, and other elements of the process are important to a
student’s success. Emphasize their many avenues of support – the
instructor, their peers, the consultants in the Writing Center, and the
reference librarians.

[/expand]

[expand title="Multimodal" tag="h3"]

The multimodal assignment revises the research paper into another mode.
This assignment is worth 10-15% of the student’s final grade.

Areas to highlight: This assignment is perhaps the most individualized
by theme; however, problems with technology will the biggest issue.
Instructors should take advantage of Andrew Davis (Lamar Hall Ste. B, Rm
22) to learn how to teach the technology to students. Instructors should
keep in mind that this assignment can be as low or high tech as wanted.

In general, since this assignment is most often paired with the research
papers, students may be tired of their subject or be reluctant to cut
their papers. Further, failures in the paper version may translate to
problems with the multimodal project. Try to return the research paper
back as quickly as possible to alleviate this issue and try not to
double-penalize them.

[/expand]

[expand title="Commonplace Book" tag="h3"]

The commonplace book is a personalized space for recording, organizing,
and reflecting on a student’s learning. This semester-long project
incorporates daily, weekly, and unit reflections, culminating in a final
reflective post. This assignment is worth 15% of the student’s final
grade.

Areas to highlight: Students are generally unfamiliar with
self-reflection and metacognition and need many opportunities throughout
the semester to practice. Many will need help with being more specific
about their learning. Students may have difficulty demonstrating their
progress, or lack thereof, through examples, often resorting to more
telling than showing. Students may also struggle to understand how
tagging can be a mechanism to represent the larger structures of their
learning.

[/expand]

Themes
------

There are five themes for WRIT 102. Each theme is based on the same
assignment sequence and outcomes, but may use different texts. [expand
title="Pop Culture" tag="h3"]

We are surrounded by a constant stream of pop culture from films, music,
television, social media, advertising, and many other media. But how
often do we stop to ask ourselves what it all means? In this theme of
WRIT 102, we will examine the various ways in which we influence and are
influenced by pop culture. Some questions we may attempt to answer are:
How are we affected by advertising? What can we learn from television,
film, and music? What are the roles of race and gender in popular
culture? Students should come into this course prepared to examine
critically and thoroughly a variety of media and sources that are often
disregarded or taken for granted.

Required Texts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Maasik, Sonia and Jack Solomon, eds. *Signs of Life in the USA:
   Readings on Popular Culture for Writers*. 8th Edition. Boston:

-  *Reading Pop Culture: A Portable Anthology,* 2nd edition, Bedford/St.
   Martin's

[/expand]

[expand title="Power and Privilege" tag="h3"]

Systems of power and privilege create more than just acts of
discrimination in our culture, and yet these systems are invisible to
many people. This course, through a variety of readings, videos, and
supplemental material, will attempt to uncover and analyze the ways
Power/Privilege manifest in the U.S. through issues of race, gender,
class, ability, sexual orientation, and others. Students will learn to
engage this material through rhetorical techniques and strategies in a
way that enables them to join these cultural and social justice
conversations with conviction and credibility. The course may explore
such questions as: How does socioeconomic status from an early age
impact one’s path in life? Why is it so challenging to discuss systemic
issues of racism in America? How do traditional gender roles hurt
American men?

Required Texts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[/expand]

[expand title="Food" tag="h3"]

This WRIT 102 class explores writings and arguments about food in the
United States. Among many topics, we may read about the beginnings of
food and the politics of the planting, growing, and cultivation of meat
and vegetables, exploring such questions such as “should farmers receive
corn subsidies?” and “should there be government regulation on
genetically modified foods?” We may then study the effects that food has
on those who eat it. We may explore such questions as “How and why has
our diet changed over time?” and “What has contributed to the obesity
epidemic in Mississippi?”

-  **For Spring only:** Common read co-sponsored by the Southern
   Foodways Alliance and the DWR.

[/expand]

[expand title="Environment" tag="h3"]

What is the meaning of ecology and nature? What counts as an
environment? How do current issues about our environment affect our
daily lives? How do we begin to connect with and investigate the real
issues of impacting local ecologies and environments? We will read and
analyze a variety of genres—literary, social commentary, cultural
analyses, theory, and philosophy that relate to our theme.

Required Texts:

[/expand]

[expand title="Business" tag="h3"]

How many economic decisions have you made today? From what you had for
breakfast to what you decided to wear to class, your choices have been
influenced by businesses, both local and global. But there may be some
issues of which you are many not even be aware. In this class we will
explore a variety of questions related to business, including, but not
limited to: is Wal-Mart good for America? Should corporations have the
same legal rights as that of an individual person? Is out-sourcing jobs
a good idea? What ethical obligations does a business have to the
environment? to our health? to the nation?

Grading
-------

Rubrics for each project are available on the assignment library. There
is a general essay rubric which can be used with papers 1, 2, 3, and the
in-class essay. The multimodal and ePortfolio project have separate
rubrics.

Sharing the rubric with students at the beginning of each unit, and
using the rubric to determine the project’s final grade, helps students
understand the expectations for each project and the reasons for the
final grade. Using the rubric to determine grades also provides
consistency across sections of Writing courses. Projects should be
graded within one week of submission.

Paper #1 is an analysis of a single text. This can be a response paper
to an author’s argument or a profile or analysis of a person, place, or
thing. It should be 3-4 pages with at least a single entry on the Works
Cited page and is worth 10% of the student’s final grade.

Areas to highlight: This assignment will help students learn to look
closely at a text (academic or otherwise) and begin the fundamentals of
quoting and citation. Because some students may have had a disruption in
time between a WRIT 100/101/equivalent course and a WRIT 102 course
(even if it is only winter break), it is recommended that instructors go
over thesis statements and paragraph construction that students should
have learned in WRIT 100/101. Students may also need help in
understanding the difference between summary and analysis.

Paper #3 is the research paper where students will come up with their

research question alone. This special care and attention will make the
process much more manageable. Emphasize their many avenues of support –
the instructor, their peers, the consultants in the Writing Center, and
the reference librarians.

Areas to highlight: Though themes may ask students to do different
tasks, students are often most frustrated with locating and evaluating
sources. Instructors should go over plagiarism issues such as correct
citation and using paraphrases. Though challenging, this assignment
gives students practice in working with texts for their longer research
paper.

DWR Commonplace Books make use of the
`Edblogs@UM <http://edblogs.olemiss.edu>`__ platform. Edblogs is based
on WordPress, so if you've kept a blog before, you'll be very familiar
with the interface. This page of the guide should address any technical
concerns you have with using Commonplace Books in the classroom.

If you're teaching WRIT 100, 101, or 102, your students' Commonplace
Books will be prepopulated before the semester begins based on
enrollment data. They will be able to log in on Day 1 through
http://edblogs.olemiss.edu to access their template-based commonplace
book. If you're teaching another course and you want to have your
student sites pre-built, please contact `Andrew
Davis <mailto:addavis@olemiss.edu>`__ before the beginning of the
semester.

[expand title="Instructor Sites and Class Blogs" tag="h2"] In order to
make the most effective use of the Edblogs platform, and to interact
with student commonplace books, we recommend that all instructors create
at least one site to use as a class blog. Everyone receives a default
site on Edblogs@UM for their username. **We recommend not using this
default site as your class blog**. There are a number of reasons for
this, but basically this ensures that you don't have to go erase and
recreate content at the beginning of the semester. There are a few
different ways you might go about using class blogs:

1. **Create one class blog**: If you are teaching only one class, or
   you're teaching multiple sections of the same class, it may be
   easiest for you to create a single class blog for the semester.
2. **Create a class blog for each course**: If you teach multiple
   sections of the same course, you may want to create a single class
   blog for them. For example, you might create a class blog for your 2
   WRIT 101 sections and another for your 2 WRIT 102 sections.
3. **Create class blogs for each section**: If you teach different
   courses, or you want to keep your classes separated in Edblogs, you
   can create a class blog for each section you teach.

Use the following guidelines when creating a new site:

-  **Site Name**: follow the format "webIDsemesteryearcoursesection," so
   an example would be "**addavisfa1610112"** for Andrew Davis's Fall
   2016 WRIT 101 Section 12. You can use a different format **as long as
   your Web ID comes first** in the site name. Your site name must use
   all lower-case letters, numbers, and no special characters.
-  **Site Title:** This should be the visible title you want for the
   course, so "Andrew Davis's WRIT 101 Section 12" might be an example

**Privacy Options**:
''''''''''''''''''''

Class blogs permissions should be set as the default (Only Registered
users of this site have access) or above. Many teachers make their class
blogs public.

**Template:**
'''''''''''''

It's up to you whether or not you want to build a class blog from
scratch or use one of the built-in templates.

Enable Class Blog Settings
--------------------------

From the dashboard of your new site, click the "My Class" tab and select
"Create a Class." Check the box for "This is a class blog" and select
the settings you want for the class blog.

.. figure:: images/class-blog-4.png
   :alt: setup class blog

   setup class blog

What do these settings mean?

**Allow Students to Post**: If you only want the class blog to show
posts from you, leave the setting as the default. If you want students
to be able to post to the class blog, you can decide whether you want to
moderate (approve) their posts or let them post freely.

**Moderation on Student Blogs**: Unless you have specific concerns, we
recommend leaving these unchecked. You don't have time to go through and
approve every single post a student makes on their own blog, and you
want them to have ownership of their own commonplace books.

**Privacy:** The only FERPA compliant option is "I would like only
registered users of each blog to see it." Please get student permission
before you choose a different option.

When you're done, click save.

You should repeat this process for each site you created to be a class
blog. Switch sites by hovering over "My Site" in the administrative
toolbar at the top of every Edblogs page.

**In order for students to join your class blog**, they should click "My
Class > Join a Class" on their own dashboard, and enter your class
blog's name to request access. For example, a student would enter
**addavisFA1610112** to join the class blog for Andrew Davis's Fall 2016
WRIT 101 Section 12 class.

Student Samples
===============

We have curated several example commonplace books from students who
participated in the 2015-2016 pilot courses. These exemplars were chosen
by pilot instructors because they model best practices for commonplace
book, and demonstrate authentic reflection. Students consented to the
release of their work to be shared with faculty and other students.

`Go Back <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/upload>`__

Because our first-year students often have different teachers for their
second-semester Writing course, it's important for teachers to do some
end-of-semester house keeping to ensure that students are able to join
their second-semester class blogs. **The only required step is the first
one,** which disassociates student blogs from your class blog. The other
steps are optional based on your personal preferences.

*Please note that these guidelines do not apply to Fastrack sections.* 

--------------

Removing Student Blogs
----------------------

You should remove all student student blogs from your class blog. Go to
your class blog's dashboard. Under the "My Class" tab, click "Student
Blogs." Then, go through and check the box next to each student name
(unfortunately there is no "select all" at this time). At the top of the
page, select "Remove from class." On the next screen, click "continue"
to confirm the removal. You will need to repeat this process until all
of the student blogs are detached from your class blog.

.. raw:: html

   </iframe>

--------------

Removing Student Users
----------------------

Even if you detach student blogs from the class blog, students will
still be users of the class blog. It will remain accessible in their "My
Sites," though just as a regular site as opposed to a class blog. If you
don't mind former students retaining this access, you can skip this
step.

To remove student users from your class blog, select the "Users" tab
from the dashboard of the class blog. Select all of the student users
you want to remove. Then, select "Remove" in the "Bulk Actions" menu and
select apply. On the next page, confirm that you want to remove student
users from the class blog.

   </iframe>

--------------

Hiding Old Class Blogs
----------------------

If you plan to create new class blogs each semester and you don't want
to see the previous semester's class blogs in your "My Sites" listing,
you can hide the site from your administrative dashboard. From the
dashboard, click "My Sites" from the header menu. Find the class blog
you want to hide and check "Hide this blog in Admin Bar" and click "Save
Changes." This will hide the old class blog from the "My Sites" menu.

We ask that you do not **delete** old class blogs. If you want your
class blog archived (and inaccessible), please contact `Andrew
Davis <mailto:addavis@olemiss.edu>`__.

DWR Commonplace Books make use of the
`Edblogs@UM <http://edblogs.olemiss.edu/>`__ platform. Edblogs is based
on WordPress, so if you’ve kept a blog before, you’ll be very familiar
with the interface. This page of the guide should address any technical
concerns you have with using Commonplace Books in the classroom

We are making some minor changes to the onboarding process for
Commonplace Books in 2017. These changes are in response to feedback
from teachers and students about the My Class plugin and the
difficulties users had with losing access. \ **We are no longer using
the My Class** **feature**. Instead, you will use the built in WordPress
subscriber user role to access your student blogs. Though there are a
couple of more steps in the beginning, we think you will find the
process smoother overall.

You will no longer have a class blog by default. The majority of our
teachers did not use their class blogs, and their presence just confused
students. \ **If you want to have a blog for your class**, you can
create one and have your students subscribe to it.

In the past, we generated student blogs in advance based on your class
rolls. This process bogged down the system and led to errors. Going
forward, each student will generate a blog and add the instructor as a
subscriber.

Student instructions are available as a
`handout <https://olemiss-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/addavis_olemiss_edu/EcTjGqOJQeFEtU15HPz-qMMBkkRq4aGb_iG2ONhUdek3jQ?e=WI5ksk>`__
and on the `student startup
page <http://edblogs.olemiss.edu/getting-started/>`__ of
edblogs.olemiss.edu.

In the past, you submitted your class rolls to us to generate your
student commonplace books. This year, you'll be using the class roll to
create Reader lists of your student blogs. Many of you asked for a way
to divide your students up by section in the Reader: this method will
allow you to do that.

Don't do this until your students have created their own blogs and
subscribed to you (so you won't have to go back and add students later).
We recommend creating your reader list(s) at the end of the first week
of classes.

You will not be creating separate class blogs (unless you want to).
Students will add your username as a subscriber. Your username is
whatever comes before the @ in your email address.

Creating Reader Lists
---------------------

Instead of pulling your class rolls from MyOleMiss, this time you'll
pull them from Blackboard.

**Go to the Full Grade Center** in your Blackboard course. From the
toolbar at the top of your gradebook, click "Work Offline" and select
"Download."

WordPress dashboard. You should see the Reader. Notice "My Lists" in the
right sidebar.

.. figure:: images/5-1.png

**Click "Create New List."** You can name the list by section if you
want to divide your reader by section. Or, if you want all your students
combined, just name the list with the semester. Paste the usernames that
you copied from the Excel spreadsheet into the box and click "Create."

.. figure:: images/6-1.png

**You can now click on the list from your Reader** to view only the
student blogs from the named section or semester. You can manage the
list by clicking the small sprocket next to its name. From the manage
screen, you can add or remove student blogs or delete the list
completely.\ |image18|

Why?
~~~~

The DWR maintains a teaching-centered culture and wants every teacher to
be successful. As faculty, we learn from each other and share ideas. We
value academic freedom, appropriate levels of standardization,
research-based pedagogies, and deliberate innovation. We believe
teaching can be improved through purposeful reflection. Regular
classroom observations help to improve our teaching practices. We learn
as much from observing others as we learn from being observed. This
ongoing exchange of ideas strengthens our culture by showcasing and
improving the unique contributions we each bring to the profession. As a
routine of support and collegiality, we expect that teaching
observations will protect and enhance our high pedagogical standards.

When?
~~~~~

**All faculty**, regardless of rank or position, must be observed during
their first semester of teaching at UM. These formative observations
(through which colleagues provide feedback to one another) should be
conducted by a core faculty member, the assistant chair, or the chair.

**All other faculty,** regardless of rank or position, must be observed
once every three regular (fall/spring) semesters. These formative
observations should be conducted by a full-time DWR faculty member, the
assistant chair, or the chair.

**All graduate instructors**, regardless of experience, must be observed
before midterm of their first semester of UM teaching and once more at
any point during the remainder of their first year. In the second year
of teaching and beyond, graduate instructors must be observed once per
year. These formative observations should be conducted by a core faculty
member.

**All faculty seeking promotion** should be observed in the year prior
to promotion. These summative observations (through which instruction is
evaluated) should be conducted by the chair, the assistant chair, or a
core faculty member who is senior in rank.

**Faculty who teach online** should submit each distinct course taught
for evaluation once every three regular (fall/spring) semesters. These
holistic evaluations should be conducted by the DWR instructional
designer and/or online faculty members designated by him or her in
conjunction with the Division of Outreach Online Course Enrichment
program. For teachers who also teach face-to-face classes, this
evaluation is in addition to their regular observations.

How?
~~~~

Faculty members and graduate instructors schedule their own
observations. After the observation, the observer will submit an
observation report through the Teaching Hub. The report will be
distributed to the observer, the observed faculty member, and optionally
the core instructor the course observed. Online course evaluations, in
addition to being shared with the above-referenced individuals, are
shared with the Division of Outreach. The schedule for online course
evaluation is maintained by the DWR instructional designer in
coordination with the Division of Outreach.

The department recognizes that various methods of peer observation are
effective. Faculty and observers work together to choose a method from
the list below. Materials for these methods are available in the DWR
document library.

1. DWR Observation Checklist
2. DWR Observation Short Narrative
3. Small Group Instructional Diagnosis (SGID)
4. Online Course Evaluation
5. TPEG/Pro-Teach Model (pilot)

[expand title="What are best practices for DWR teaching observations?"
tag="h4"]

-  To establish trust and reciprocity, create teaching observation
   partnerships or triads with colleagues.
-  Build variety by partnering with different colleagues and using
   different methods over time.
-  If you have trouble finding a partner or group, reach out to the
   communications specialist for names of faculty members who have not
   yet been observed.
-  Keep the observation forms and their content private. Share the forms
   only with the faculty member observed, the DWR communications
   specialist, and, for online course evaluations, the appropriate
   curriculum committee chair.
-  Keep in mind the distinction between formative observations (to
   provide feedback to a colleague) and summative observations (to
   evaluate instruction). Remember that summative observations only
   occur in the year prior to promotion.
-  Pre-observation conversations via email or in person allow colleagues
   to pinpoint areas for focused observation.
-  Post-observation conversations via email or in person allow
   colleagues to share ideas and learn from each other.
-  Be mindful that teaching observations have limitations, including
   unforeseen circumstances, collegiality issues, and biases about
   pedagogy, subject matter, etc. They are a snapshot of one teacher in
   one class on one day.

Outline of DWR Strategic Plan
-----------------------------

In Spring 2018, the Strategic Planning Task force developed 32 action
items for the department's strategic plan. These action items are
classified into four general goals/objectives: **Students**, **Faculty
and Staff**, **Department**, and **Partnerships and Collaborations**.
These objectives and action items will serve as the frame for the
strategic plan being developed in Summer 2018.

Mission Statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Department of Writing and Rhetoric provides student-centered,
inquiry-based instruction and support to advance the skills of
effective, responsible thinking, speaking, and writing within and beyond
the university setting.

Draft Vision Statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Department of Writing and Rhetoric leads the University in creating
and sustaining a diverse, inclusive culture of effective writers and
speakers.

--------------

Strategic Planning Task Force
-----------------------------

In Fall 2017, a task force was created to study the department, collect
information from faculty, and eventually develop a strategic plan for
the DWR. The task force was made up of DWR faculty and staff who met
once a week for the duration of the Fall and Spring semesters. Between
surveys and focus groups, over 90% of faculty participated in the
strategic planning process.

Process Overview

Timeline and Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**11 Sep 2017**: Questionnaire sent to all individuals in DWR as Google
Form​ **19 Sep 2017:** Deadline postponed to encourage more responses
from individuals​ **25 Sep 2017:** 37 individual responses received;
form closed​ **25 Sep 2017:** Questionnaire sent to all standing
committees and teaching circles​ **31 Oct 2017:**  Questionnaire for
committees and teaching circles closed.​

Over the past few months, the DWR SP Taskforce members met every Tuesday
and Thursday afternoon for one-hour meetings. Ten meetings were held
prior to Nov 8, 2017.

Meetings were open to all interested departmental members. DWR members
attending the meetings included:  Sheena Boran, Brad Campbell, Bob
Cummings, Andrew Davis, Karen Forgette, Ashley Jones-Bodie, Joanne
Mitchell, Alice Myatt, Chad Russell, Glenn Schove, Colleen Thorndike,
and Sarah Wilson.

During the first week, the Taskforce discussed and revised the timeline
for the "Sensemaking" stage of the overall process and how this work
would be used by the department moving forward after December 1.

Major discussion focused on the process for gathering departmental
members’ input on mission, vision, and departmental concerns and focus.
During the first week, 25% of departmental members had responded to the
individual survey. The Taskforce extended the deadline and asked Glenn
Schove to make a personal, e-mail request to increase the number of
members responding. After the extended deadline, 37 total individual
survey responses were received.

To prepare the individual responses for review, Joanne Mitchell and Chad
Russell compiled the individual responses into a report with anonymous
responses organized by survey questions. The summary document of survey
responses totaled approximately 28 pages of content for the 11 question
items covering mission, vision, issues, and strengths.

In addition to sending out an individual survey to departmental members,
the Taskforce asked departmental groups to also respond to survey
questions, functioning as informal focus groups. The groups included the
teaching circles, the curriculum committees, the writing centers. Groups
leaders were able to determine their own process for recording the
group’s responses and submitting those responses to the Taskforce. Group
feedback was submitted throughout the month of October. Responses from
the groups were compiled into a summary document, organized by survey
question. The document totaled approximately 15 pages of content.

To review and create a preliminary synthesis of the individual survey
responses, the group spent multiple meetings working in pairs around the
room examining individual questions for themes in the answers. Then, the
pairs shared their findings with the full group and discussion focused
on confirming the lists of findings as representative of the spirit and
content of the individual responses. In following meetings, the group
members prepared individual mission and vision statements and worked to
combine them into draft mission and vision statements that reflected the
focus and spirit of the survey responses. Then, Taskforce members read
the compiled group responses and brought suggested changes to the draft
mission and vision statements to a following meeting. The group
determined that a shared progress report of the findings should be
created. Bob Cummings created a synthesis of departmental issues and
strengths which was reviewed by the Taskforce to confirm it reflected
the spirit and content of those survey responses.

In addition to work on the departmental survey, the Taskforce spent
multiple meetings reviewing proposed, basic departmental bylaws. The
group read through each item included in the draft bylaws, debated
individual policy statements and the merits of including each in the
basic bylaws. The group’s goal was to create a basic document that could
serve as an accurate reflection of current departmental practice. Any
policies that seemed divisive to the group or warranted more time in
discussion were moved to the appendix of the document.​

--------------

Mission and Vision Surveys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The task force distributed sets of questions to individuals stakeholders
in the department, as well as to committees and other small groups.
These questions addressed the DWR's mission and vision. The task force
has used faculty feedback from these surveys to draft mission and vision
plans.

DWR policy requires all faculty to be observed at least once per
three-semester cycle (see the `Observation
Policy <https://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/policies/directory/>`__). Due to
COVID-19 restrictions, the current cycle has been expanded to include
the Spring 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Fall 2021 semesters.
Covid-19 restrictions make face-to-face classroom observations unwise
during the Spring 2021 semester. If, however, you would like an
observation of remote or hybrid teaching during the Spring 2021
semester, please use the following procedure.

Use the request form below to ask a colleague to serve as your observer.
Your observer will confirm your request and ask to be added to your
online classroom space. If you use Blackboard, the observer should be
added as a “Course Builder.” The observer will then “observe” your
course, using the criteria below as a starting point. You might also ask
the observer to join a class session on Zoom if that would be
feasible/desired. Finally, set up a Zoom session with the observer to
discuss the observation as well as any other pedagogical areas outside
of the course space that you would like to highlight, such as
communication, grading and workflow, student issues, collegiality, etc.
Following the discussion, the observer will submit the completed Short
Narrative form below through the Teaching Hub and you will receive a
copy through email.

Speech 210 (1cr) provides intensive skills training to prepare students
for job interviews. Particular attention is given to tailoring
application materials and increasing virtual presentation skills. Two
versions of the course currently exist – full 15-week and 7-week
mini-mester.

Course Design
-------------

Spch 210 is designed as an intensive, skills-based course focused on
deliverables. By the end of the course, students should have engaged in
a variety of interview processes and created job search materials, which
should be useful as they engage in future employment endeavors. The
course allows students repeated opportunities to engage six phases of
job interviewing: 1) analyzing career opportunities, 2) examining the
role of social media, 3) building a network, 4) tailoring a cover letter
and resume to a specific position, 5) identifying types of interview
questions, 6) constructing responses to common interview questions
during telephone, video, and live, virtual interviews.

`SPCH 210 Assignment
Library <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/alib/spch210/>`__

--------------

Core Assignment Descriptions
----------------------------

**Introduction video and discussion:** The introduction video serves two
purposes: 1) to lay the ground work for an online, learning community
and 2) to assess the current video/camera, presentation skills of
students. The video should be two to three minutes, and students should
be asked to make a favorable first impression and encouraged to respond
to each other’s posts.

**Syllabus quiz:** To ensure students have read and understand the
course policies and procedures, require a syllabus quiz by the end of
the first week.

**SOAR analysis and discussion:** The SOAR analysis is an off-shoot of
the analysis method used in some businesses. Students select a specific
job or internship to pursue during the course. Students should be
qualified for the position and analyze their strengths in relation to
the position and the hiring organization, the opportunities the position
will provide for advancing career goals, how personal aspirations
connect to the position, and finally their readiness to take on the
position. Students should discuss each other's analysis.

**30-second commercial:** A fully edited video introduction with good
production values, the “commercial” can last 30-60 seconds and is
essentially an elevator pitch, which will form the foundation for career
fair introductions, LinkedIn summaries, and cover letters. The content
should express central ideas discovered in the SOAR analysis.

**LinkedIn Page:** Students should demonstrate an ability to engage the
interest of future employers by crafting an audience-oriented profile
and listing relevant experience and media.

**Cover Letter and Resume:** The cover letter and resume should be
targeted to the position or internship the students chose at the
beginning of the semester. On the page, students should demonstrate
ability to organize and arrange material for easy flow. Special
attention should be given to organization, format, content, proofing,
and concision.

I\ **nterviewStream & discussion:** Instructors will make a 5-10
question interview appropriate to the position the student has chosen.
Students should demonstrate competency for verbal and nonverbal language
and technical ability. Students should peer review or discuss the
InterviewStream videos.

**Telephone Interview:** Instructors will create an individual
interview, screening script to engage each student with questions
appropriate to the position the student has chosen to pursue.

**Final (Skype-type) Interview:** Students will create a short
presentation in response to a prompt, which should be appropriate for
the position being pursued. The presentation should demonstrate oral and
virtual communication skills, as well as a conversation starter.
Questions for this interview are more flexible and responsive.

**Worksheets** provide necessary preparation for core assignments.
During the minimester format, some students may have difficulty turning
in worksheets in time for meaningful feedback before an assignment
deadline. You may schedule worksheets and/or include the worksheets in
the overall scoring; you may also give students the option to turn in
worksheets by a set date if the student desires feedback (but not
require the worksheets be turned in). Turning in worksheets during the
15-week course is advised to keep students engaged and motivated.

**Discussion boards** provide social learning and peer-to-peer feedback
opportunities. Consider prompts that will challenge students to provide
meaningful commentary.

--------------

Grading
-------

Rubrics for each project are available in the assignment library. Please
share the rubric with students at the beginning of each unit. Please
submit the rubric to Blackboard grades to help with departmental
assessment. Using the rubric to determine grades also provides
consistency across sections of DWR courses. The goal is to provide
grades and feedback to students within one week of presentations.

The DWR requires that all Web courses are reviewed once every three
semesters. Even if a faculty member is observed teaching face-to-face,
each unique web WRIT or SPCH course must have a review on file. For
example, if James is teaching one section of WRIT 101 face-to-face, two
sections of WRIT 250 online, and one section of WRIT 310 online, he must
receive a review for WRIT 250 and a review for WRIT 310.

About this Guide
----------------

This guide is for first time instructors and was created in response to
suggestions by former instructors. It has three primary functions.

1. **Handbook replacement.** Because WRIT 102 no longer uses a handbook,
   we thought this guide would be helpful to new instructors for
   collecting resources that they could use in the classroom.
2. **Troubleshooting guide**. The committee also drew on their
   experiences in the 102 classroom to pull together a troubleshooting
   guide about areas we noticed that our students consistently struggle
   with.
3. **Class management:** Because new instructors sometimes find it
   challenging to pace out a class meeting, we have created detailed
   class plans that should give you a rough idea of how long different
   class activities might take. These instructional guides are not
   mandatory; we invite you to modify any materials based on your
   comfort your learning goals for each class.

Paper #1 is an analysis of a single text. This can be a response paper
to an author’s argument or a profile or analysis of a person, place, or
thing. It should be 3-4 pages with at least a single entry on the Works
Cited page and is worth 10-15% of the student’s final grade.

Summary vs. Analysis
--------------------

Students by and large are skilled at writing summaries. The main thing
to look out for is students who don’t understand that patchwriting or
plain old plagiarism does not make summary.

Another problem with students’ summaries is that they easily slide into
analysis or argument without realizing it. Many students have a problem
with identifying their own bias; to them, the way they see the world is
self-evident and pure fact. This is in part a problem of audience
awareness. Their summaries, then, use loaded terms or absolutes to
describe what they are summarizing. Neither you nor the students can fix
this by pointing it out in the comments to a paper. This is a
distinction they must practice.

To begin the basics of making students see the difference, all semester
I ask students two questions: What does a summary ask? and What does an
analysis ask? The answers are “What?” and “How?” When you summarize, you
write what the source is doing or saying. When you analyze, you write
how the source is doing or saying it. After that, if the student is
writing a critique as part of their analysis, they write a judgment of
how well the source is doing or saying it.

Reinforce this distinction by asking students to identify those
different rhetorical moves in example essays. Hand out markers and have
students mark up their own or a peer’s draft, or color code an example
on the board as a class.

[expand title="MWF Schedule" tag="h4"][expandsub1 title="Day 1"
tag="h4"]

Call Roll (5 mins)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some students might not be on your roll and others may be on the
waitlist. You can print out a roll (including one with photos) on
myolemiss. Ask students how to pronounce names; many will go by middle
names. Ask for any students on waitlist. How you keep roll from here on
out is up to you. Some people pass out a blank piece of paper which is
signed as a record of their attendance in their own handwriting; others
call roll everyday; some people have a question which students answer as
the roll is called (this can be related to the current reading or lesson
and can be a daily grade); eventually some people can take roll quickly
by just looking at the class. Whatever process you come up with, decide
how to deal with tardy students and do not conflate tardies with
absences (unless they are very late).

If students do not show up to the first day of class and have not
contacted you, you may request to have that student dropped. It’s up to
you but if a waitlist student shows up, you might consider doing the
drop so that student can take that place. You can request the drop by
contacting Glenn Schove or Joanne Mitchell (provide student name, ID,
course name and number).

Syllabus Review (15 mins)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  contact information
-  attendance policy
-  textbooks
-  other policies that you think are important

It’s important to review certain parts of the syllabus for students but
you don’t have to go over everything. Stress to the students that the
attendance policy is a department policy and cannot be changed. Any WRIT
102 class will have the same policy. I like to show them what the
textbooks look like, and I often scan in the first readings because
students will delay buying them because of financial aid. If you have
time, you can show them how to annotate an essay by showing them yours.
Highlight anything in your syllabus that is unique to you and different
from your peers. Remember that you are to have a minimum of one office
hour per class (but with a minimum of two hours) a week. You should also
have “by appointment” because some students may have class at that time.

`Differences between 101 and 102 <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/writing/writ102/handbook/challenges#differences>`__ (5 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commonplace Book: First Reflection (20 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most students will probably already be familiar with CPB if they took
WRIT 100/101 at UM. However, a number will not. If you do not have a CPB
yourself, you will need to have your CPB set up before this class so
that you know your user name to give to students. Have all your students
go to `Getting Started with
Edblogs <http://edblogs.olemiss.edu/getting-started/>`__ There, they
will receive instructions for how to log in and how to add your user
name so you can read their blog. We recommend that you write your
username on the whiteboard. Some students will have different levels of
comfort with this process, and you may have to help some of them. Go
ahead and assign the first reflection while you help them. The first
reflection can completed as homework for those who are behind.

Daily Write: What are your hopes and fears for this class?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Give guidelines to your students -- write complete sentences; write
continuously for five minutes; encourage them to be specific and to
point to different experiences in writing classes. This will be a useful
point for them to return to when they compose their epilogue post at the
end of the class. Good reflective writing takes practice and time. You
will want to read these first reflections to get a sense of your
students; you do not have to comment on everybody’s (but it’s a nice
touch to reference some student’s point -- without naming them -- at the
next class meeting; it shows them that you are engaged with their
writing).

Homework
~~~~~~~~

reading from textbook; complete first reflection [/expandsub1]

[expandsub1 title="Day 2"  tag="h4"]

Icebreaker activity: Interviews (35 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usually I put students into pairs and tell them to interview their peer;
after 5 minutes or so, they will report back to the class as a whole
introducing their peer. Tell them to pair with someone they don’t
already know. I tell them to be sure to ask about the student’s name,
major, hometown, interesting fact, or any basic get-to-know-you
questions. I usually come up with some other question related to the
theme. Be sure to give students a 1-minute warning to review what they
know or else they will not remember their peer’s name but remember the
name of their childhood pet.

Discussion of reading (15 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See “\ `Leading a
Discussion. <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/writing/writ102/handbook/management#discussion>`__"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pass out the rubric as well.

These can be handouts that you ask them to review them for next class.
Some students like to get a headstart. You can print out copies for them
but at least have them on Blackboard.

Reading Discussion(20 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thesis Statements Discussion (20 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students are probably familiar with thesis statements but might have
learned narrow rules about it. First, some students will want to write
the three point, five paragraph essay. Explain that this is a simpler,
less complex way to do a thesis statement. I like to tell students that
what connects the three points is the true thesis. You can use the
handout to review certain rules about thesis statements. You may change
the examples on the handout, especially to fit the kind of thesis
statement you want to see in the analysis papers. You can also pull
thesis statements from the sample papers (reinforce this lesson on day 6
when you look at the full student sample papers). Ask students to
evaluate the thesis statements.

Analysis Paper Discussion (10 minutes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your discussion of the analysis paper, review the expectations of the
assignment and ask for any questions. You might consider asking if they
have experience with writing analyses. If they took WRIT 100/101, they
wrote such a paper. You can then ask them about their experiences there
and what advice they have for the class.

[expand title="Differences Between 101 and 102" id="differences"
tag="h4"] As part of Syllabus Day, I like to stress to my students that
101 and 102 are different courses with different aims doing different
things. The course objectives on the syllabus are different in 101 and
102, so this is the perfect day to address the topic. My students may
not themselves see any difference and feel frustrated that they have to
take yet another non-major course they aren’t interested in. I may have
repeat students who need to know that they are not going to be bored
getting a full rehash of what they just learned from me in 101. It’s
good for me to remind myself that the classes are different so that I
prepare different materials for the different levels of student. 101 is
more geared toward introducing students to the standards of college
writing. They begin with a personal narrative and graduate to making
arguments on more academic topics. 102 is more geared to including
research and outside sources into different genres of argument.
[/expand]

[expand title="Effective Peer Review" tag="h4" id="pr"] I created the
attached assignment sheet because it accomplishes two different goals.
1) it provides a flawed but passable introduction for students to
practice providing good and bad feedback to a peer. 2) it is from a
for-profit assignment mill, showing students that their money would be
wasted if they were to cheat in that way. [/expand]

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut elementum

[expand title="Leading a Discussion" tag="h4" id="discussion"] Students
contribute best in a classroom where they feel like their opinions
matter and they will not be attacked for saying the wrong thing. You
begin creating this atmosphere from the first day with the students’ own
introductions. Pay attention and look them in the eye when they speak.
Both large and small gestures of respect help your students know they
are not anonymous and will be held accountable for speaking when
appropriate. We all sometimes come up with discussion prompts on the
spot due to inspiration of brilliance or failure to plan. However,
having a plan with specific objectives going into the classroom
increases your odds of having a successful discussion. Some of this will
stem from readings you have assigned or PowerPoints you have created. In
a writing class in particular, it is beneficial to direct students to
the text for specific examples and evidence for what they are saying.
Once you’ve determined the scope of the discussion (one essay, one
skill, etc.), continue focusing the conversation before you even walk in
the classroom. What topics do you want your students to discuss using
that specific text? Higher-order essay organization? Quote inclusion?
Potential paper topics they are interested in? Figure out at least one
or two ways to ask or tell your students what you want from them –
sometimes students don’t understand what you are asking of them, and
thinking of ways to rephrase help you clarify to yourself what you want
them to say. About halfway through the semester, I can ask my students,
“What did you think about the reading?” and they will respond
appropriately because they know the type of thing that is relevant to
discuss in the writing classroom. I can’t ask that question on day one
because they have not yet been prepped. Their answers to that question
would reflect personal enjoyment rather than technical analysis.
Instead, it is useful to begin the semester by teaching them terms and
asking them to identify those concepts in the example text. “This is the
definition of summary. Where does the author summarize?” “This is the
definition of pathos. Does the author use pathos?” After mapping out
what the text is doing, move on to more analytical questions. “Are you
convinced by this argument? What could make it even better?” Having a
plan for the day, whether you are a first-time teacher or have years of
experience, will give you confidence. Students can tell your mood and
reflect it back to you. Try to feel generally upbeat and encouraging.
You don’t want to experience a bad hour all semester, and neither do
they. You and the students are on the same team, fighting ignorance and
inexperience – or at least you can be. [/expand]

[expand title="Netiquette" tag="h4" id="netiquette"] I always hand out
the attached “netiquette” handout (from a former colleague, drawn from
the source cited on the page) early in the semester. This lessens the
number of emails I get in which students fail to address me, use proper
grammar, or provide context for their questions. It’s not exactly
teaching them business writing, but we are teaching writing, and they
will need to write at least semi-professionally when they enter the
professional world. [/expand]

[expand title="Reading in Class" tag="h4"] Sometimes you might find a
short passage or essay that you want to share with the class but that
was not assigned as homework. Students will read at different speeds and
the time pressure might be stressful for some students. You can try to
give them the time to finish or, if you don’t have the time, you can
tell them it’s okay not to finish the passage. http://readtime.eu/ can
give you a rough idea of estimates if you have the ability to copy and
paste your text into it ahead of time. If you want your students to take
notes or otherwise read carefully, allow more time.

Having students read out loud a sentence or passage out loud in class
can break up the monotony a bit. Further, you want students to be
confident doing such a task. However, be mindful that some students will
be especially nervous about doing this activity. I tend to ask for
volunteers or do short readings that go around the room. If a student
stumbles over a word, you can provide a correct pronunciation if it’s a
tough word but do so in a way that draws attention to the fact. If it’s
a common word that is mispronounced, I would tend to let it go unless it
confuses the meaning of the passage. If you have a very quiet class and
no one volunteers to read, you can integrate more reading out loud
activities in small groups to boost their confidence. [/expand]

of instruction to work in to the first unit, and I never seem to have
much time for students to work on the actual paper draft in class. This
means that students have to be continually working on the paper outside
of class. Since most students are prone to procrastination, we need to
keep them accountable with small deadlines each day leading up to the
final due date. The way that this works could look different in every
classroom. You might have students bring in an outline, a thesis
statement, one paragraph, half of the draft, or some other smaller units
before the day to bring in the full draft for peer review. They might
offer peer review in pairs or groups. You might have students read their
work aloud for the whole class to critique. If your students post their
work to the Commonplace Book, you can pull volunteer or random blogs up
on the projector to workshop as a class. Alternatively, you could make a
discussion board post on Blackboard and assign students to offer
critiques in response posts. If you plan these units out early enough,
you can list all these mini- due dates on the syllabus or assignment
sheet so that students have an example of process at a glance and are
less likely to forget a step in the process. [/expand]

[expand title="Recurring CPB Posts" tag="h4"] When I first began using
the Commonplace book, my students did very few weekly writes simply
because I would run out of time in class to assign them. Instead, I came
up with a recurring weekly write question. The instructions are on the
syllabus, so students know what to do from the very beginning. I require
posts 10 weeks out of the semester, but you could require more or less.
They are responsible for keeping up with the assignment all semester,
and I grade it as part of the final Commonplace book grade. I do provide
feedback sporadically throughout the semester, so that they know they
are not writing into a void. I check every student’s summaries more
closely at the beginning of the semester just to check for any problems
in their summary writing skills. The writing they generate in this
assignment makes for good material for an instructional PowerPoint to
instruct any students who are struggling. For this recurring assignment,
I have my students write a brief summary of a news article that was
written in the past week. They can write about any topic as long as it
fits within our 102 theme. Ideally, this assignment forces the students
to self-educate about something that interests them long before they
have to do research for their final, longest essay. [/expand]

Colleagues meet regularly in a community of practice centered around a
common professional interest (scholarship groups, writing groups,
reading groups, design collectives, cross-curricular projects, etc.) at
a date/time/place of the group’s choosing.

Individual instructors set specific goals and then create and follow a
plan to reach them. For example, an instructor might set a goal of
offering one DWR brown bag during the semester and attending two
university-wide brown bags and a CETL luncheon.

Use the form below to propose an individual action plan. Your proposal
should be equivalent in time and effort to attending a biweekly teaching
circle meeting or community of practice.

The proposal form will generate an action plan document that will be
sent to your email address. You should use this document to evaluate
your action plan when completing your Faculty Activity Report.

During these unprecedented times, the DWR’s small teaching circles and
communities of practice will be paused for the fall semester. Instead,
we encourage everyone to participate as they are able in the
department-wide Resilient Teaching and Learning Teaching Circle led by
Carrie McCormick and Eliot Parker. Carrie and Eliot will be sharing the
ideas and strategies they learned in the Resilient Teaching and Learning
Community summer workshops, sponsored by the UM Academic Innovations
Group. Carrie and Eliot will send everyone details about meeting dates,
times, and topics.

Additionally, if you would appreciate a chance to touch base regularly
with a small group of colleagues, consider signing up for a coffee and
conversation. These self-facilitated small groups offer the opportunity
for colleagues to support each other in informal, virtual settings at
dates and times of their choosing. Finally, remember that the core
faculty and administrators are available to help with any challenges you
face.

*Developed in Fall 2018 by: Karen Forgette, Kate Hooper, Rachel Johnson,
and Don Unger*

On March 21, 2019, at 6pm in Fulton Chapel, Alexander Heffner, host of
PBS’ ​The Open Mind​, will give a  lecture titled “Politics, Media, and
the Future of Civil Discourse.” (For more information about Heffner,
check  out ​\ *`The Open
Mind​ <https://www.thirteen.org/openmind/about-the-host/>`__* website).
We hope to use this lecture to initiate a wider discussion at the
University of  Mississippi on the nature of civil discourse and the
roles that reading, writing, speaking and listening play in  shaping it.
To that end, a group of writing and speech instructors, led by Rachel
Johnson, met over fall 2018 to  discuss how the topic enters into our
curricula and to develop materials for our spring 2019 courses. This 
teaching guide resulted from those meetings. As you are contemplating
your syllabi, assignments, readings, and  activities for next spring, we
encourage you to use these materials, or others, in order to engage
students in  conversations about civil discourse.

This first section lists texts on civil discourse and related issues.
The list items represent scholarly and popular  press articles, as well
as podcasts, websites, and other multimedia that may help shape your
knowledge of civil  discourse and/or serve as readings for your courses.
We divided this list into categories that reflect some aspects  of the
national conversation on civil discourse. These categories include:

-  Defining Civil Discourse
-  Challenges of Civil Discourse
-  Argument and Civil Discourse
-  Academic Freedom and Civil Discourse

The second section describes ​classroom activities ​ related to civil
discourse. The third section provides a sample civil discourse mini-unit
for first-year writing courses​. Finally, the fourth section offers
​other instructor resources​.

Defining Civil Discourse
------------------------

`*On Being*\ ​ ​Podcast
Episodes <https://onbeing.org/post_tag/civility/>`__ Several of these
​podcasts ​model civil discourse between people from opposing views
and/or interview people with specific ideas/methods about how to
practice civil discourse. See also the `Civil Conversations
Project <http://www.civilconversationsproject.org/conversations/>`__\ ​
from ​\ *On Being*.

`*Justice Talking​* from
NPR <http://www.justicetalking.org/ShowArchive.aspx>`__ Features
​podcast episodes​ about controversial topics in which experts debate
and discuss the issue (models civil, yet passionate discourse). Some of
the links are older and may be broken, so anything assigned from this
may need to be downloaded and hosted on a Blackboard page.

`National Institute for Civil Discourse Podcast
Series <https://nicd.arizona.edu/podcasts>`__ The University of
Arizona’s National Institute for Civil Discourse hosts a ​series of
podcasts​ devoted to civil discourse on a range of issues including fake
news, global trade, and the role of satirical media in political debate.
These podcasts run from 20 minutes to a bit more than an hour and could
be used in class or as homework assignments.

`Voters Not Politicians <https://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/>`__
Voters Not Politicians is a nonpartisan coalition working to change
redistricting laws in Michigan. Their movement and  ​website​ are
examples of “civil discourse in action.” Students could listen to the
`1A
episode <https://the1a.org/shows/2018-10-08/the-state-were-in-redistricting>`__
describing the movement and then analyze the website’s rhetoric.​

`Janus Forum Lecture Series (Brown
University) <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTiEffrOcz_4YIz1QvotlAPz9s8GwYa5F>`__
This ​YouTube channel​ features lectures organized by Brown University.
The event usually features two prominent thinkers or researchers who
present their opposing viewpoints on an issue of concern. The dialogue
between the speakers following their short lectures models civil
discourse and demonstrates how the speakers tend to agree about several
aspects of a problem -- perhaps more so than they disagree.

`Civil Discourse 101, from the Civic Education Video Series produced by
MetroEast​ <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hebHUGjmcvc>`__ A quick
​video tutorial for engaging in conversation​. The video could be used
as a pre-discussion or extended group work primer in any class.

Challenging Civil Discourse
---------------------------

`“​Dialogic Civility: A Narrative to Live By” by Shelley D.
Lane​ <http://umiss.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ufh&AN=16201256&site=ehost-live&scope=site>`__
This ​article​ provides a blueprint for engaging a public narrative of
dialogic civility. Written for ​communication instructors​, the article
informs on dialogic civility and can spark ideas for incorporating the
practice in a variety of communication courses, including online. Find
more on this topic by Shelley D. Lane in the book ​\ *`Understanding
Everyday Incivility: Why
are <http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/olemiss/detail.action?docID=5059908>`__*
`*They so
Rude?* <http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/olemiss/detail.action?docID=5059908>`__

`*The Open Mind​* (PBS with Alexander Heffner) - Interview with Teresa
Bejan <https://www.thirteen.org/openmind/free-speech/tolerating-intolerance/5717/>`__
This ​video clip​ features Teresa Bejan discussing portions of her book
​\ *Mere Civility: Disagreement and the Limits of Toleration.* Offers a
counterpoint to calls for politeness and civility and a lot of really
interesting history.

`“​There’s Nothing Virtuous About Finding Common Ground​” by Tayari
Jones <http://time.com/5434381/tayari-jones-moral-middle-myth/>`__ This​
op ed ​posits that arguments about moving to the middle or finding
common ground aren’t inherently virtuous (e.g., where is the middle
ground in arguments about slavery? Indentured servitude?). It gets at
contemporary issues undergirding what civil discourse means and how part
of this discussion means deciding who we want to be as individuals and
as a nation.

`“​You don't have to be nice to political opponents. But you do have to
talk to them.​” by Teresa
Bejan <https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/03/08/you-dont-have-to-be-nice-to-political-opponents-but-you-do-have-to-talk-to-them/?utm_term=.2a846aa9cc6c>`__
Professor and political theorist, Teresa Bejan, discusses the limits of
civility in public discourse and portions of her​ book​ ​\ *Mere
Civility: Disagreement and the Limits of Toleration*.​ She offers a lot
historical examples of uncivil discourse from figures students might be
surprised to learn were rather uncivil - like Martin Luther. Here is a
link to a `​scholarly
forum <https://tif.ssrc.org/category/exchanges/book-blog/book-forums/mere-civility/>`__\ ​
about Bejan’s book. Each response is concise and provides a specific
perspective on her arguments.

“\ `The Real Roots of American
Rage <https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/charles-duhigg-american-anger/576424/>`__:
The untold story of how anger became the dominant emotion in our
politics and personal lives—and what we can do about it” by Charles
Duhigg

Article was published in January 2019 issue of \ *The Atlantic.* Based
on a psychological study of a contented, suburban town, the article
explains how anger is a useful communication tool, which can be used to
create positive change and promote resolution in interpersonal
relationships, as well as harnessed to facilitate social change. Though
anger has an upside, history shows anger has also been manipulated for
unethical reasons and that left unchecked, rage can create lasting,
harmful effects on individuals and segments of society. Duhigg offers a
way to recognize and understand anger and deescalate rage before it
turns destructive.

A longer article, an intriguing \ **discussion or project starter for
any class looking at emotion in relation to civil discourse**.

Argument as a Basis for Civil Discourse
---------------------------------------

`“​Sustaining Arguments” from ​\ *The Ethical Practice of Critical
Thinking*\ ​ by
Fowler <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X6EyVRQe2fnkz5cFs-2_N_CGnO0kCLws/view?usp=sharing>`__
This short ​chapter​ introduces the idea of a “sustaining argument” as
the ethical obligation of a critical thinker. Fowler defines these as
“​arguments which matter, about things which matter, to​ ​people who
matter to each other​” (5). He goes on to identify specific features of
such arguments and explains that argumentation following this model is
more likely to find an audience.

`“​Reasoning and Critical Thinking​” and “​Clarifying Meaning” by Hughes
and Lavery in ​​\ *Critical Thinking: An Introduction to the Basic
Skills​* (5th
ed.) <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjFYt-vk5gNYS8Gyh1bFIpfJELOAsvRS/view?usp=sharing>`__
These ​two chapters ​are student-friendly in their length and tone. They
approach critical thinking as a function of understanding argument.
These chapters would be great for having students develop a vocabulary
about how to evaluate and understand features of arguments and
understand the principle of charity. They would pair nicely with
activities related to argument dissection and reconstruction.

`“​Argument as Emergence, Rhetoric as Love​” by Jim
Corder <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1r0ArHgboylxuv4HRN6TSnWNXZOMbka/view?usp=sharing>`__
This ​article​, published in​ Rhetoric Review​, addresses how people
develop ​as​ narratives, and even arguments, or put another way, how to
approach these narratives and arguments as who someone is. While such a
sensibility might seem a bit abstract and the article is a bit dense for
first-year students, I think that they can understand how the arguments
that we construct are part of what makes us who we are. Working from
this standpoint, the article serves as a reminder for readers/listeners
to consider how identity, narrative, and argumentation are deeply
intertwined, and Corder encourages readers to show care for another by
using rhetoric conscientiously. This article could be used in contrast
to articles that emphasize the writer or speaker’s agency as Corder
focuses on the listener/reader’s agency.

`“​Transformations in a civil discourse public speaking class: Speakers'
and listeners' attitude change” by Barbara​ Mae
Gayle <http://umiss.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ufh&AN=13078128&site=ehost-live&scope=site>`__
Published in ​\ *Communication Education*\ ​, Gayle’s ​research​
suggests researching and presenting a speech or argument from one
perspective may limit a students understanding.  A method often used in
debate classes, Gayle’s research suggests students are more likely to
adjust their beliefs on an issue after crafting a speech or argument
from opposing views.

Academic Freedom and Civil Discourse
------------------------------------

`“​Academic Freedom: A Basic Guide” by James Liszka in *Start Talking: A
Handbook for Engaging Difficult Dialogs in Higher Education​* edited by
Kay
Landis <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-gJOv6XUdtSIdDvCx4FQqS5sMW4yBai/view?usp=sharing>`__
This ​short essay​ offers a legal history on the concept of academic
freedom. It also discusses when speech is covered or not covered by the
principle of academic freedom. The concluding portion of the essay
discusses several case studies where free speech became an issue in a
classroom or higher education setting and discusses how such cases were
decided or resolved.

| `Argument Dissection and
  Reconstruction <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nybjI_eYdtes_lfl77de0mWAXRcstU6C/view?usp=sharing>`__
| The article linked above describes how to incorporate argument
  diagramming into a first year writing course to teach critical
  thinking skills. The activities/assignments described could work well
  as one day lessons or as an entire unit focused on developing or
  writing sound arguments.

| `Developing a Classroom Code of
  Civility <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zLM7m2ddXvbcu8MXuvh88pdRH3LCAgiW/view?usp=sharing>`__
| Designed for presentation courses such as Public Speaking but may be
  adapted for any course in which civility may be promoted. At the end
  of this single-class activity, students will have an understanding of
  civility in order to: (1) identify civility and consequences of
  behaviors, (2) create their own communication civility code for
  classroom behaviors and presentations, and (3) practice civility
  throughout the semester.

| `Inquiry-based Civil
  Discourse <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aT6sy7lBfJjlSzMDTeb0MtHgECCz_kAz/view>`__
| This lesson from the journal Communication Teacher is appropriate for
  speech or writing classes focused on civil discourse, argumentation,
  debate, persuasion or political communication. The unit activity will
  help students build an understanding of civil discourse and its
  function in society. Students will: (1) increase their capacity to
  examine arguments critically, (2) enhance their own ability to
  self-reflect critically, and (3) improve their ability to engage in
  civil discourse. This activity will employ inquiry-based learning
  strategies to apply students’ understanding of civil discourse in a
  dialogue with the broader campus community by partnering with campus
  media to develop and publish original opinion-editorial pieces.
  Because the DM may not be able to accomodate, classes could partner
  with various papers around the state, DWR could potentially host a FB
  or other social media page for published works in relation to the
  Civil Discourse, or speech students could verbally present their ideas
  to partner classes or an invited public audience.

It is essential for students to see the Lumen Waymaker modules as
valuable to their learning and as an integral part of the class. As
such, the modules should be part of a homework score worth between
10%-15% of the final course grade. Teachers may count the modules as the
sole component of the homework grade, or they may include other
assignments and factor the work altogether. This range works best
because it is substantive enough to demand students’ attention, but it
leaves the vast majority of the final grade to be determined by papers,
projects, and other writing.

Teachers should help students see the modules as an important part of
the class. This can happen in several ways:

Teachers can talk about them in class:

For example, a teacher may briefly cover the highlights from a module
after students have completed their work on it. Ideally, this would
involve explaining connections to the major paper or project that the
class is working on at the time.

Teachers can refer to them in feedback:

    For example, a teacher may make a comment on an analysis draft for
    the student to refer back to the “Rhetorical Appeals” module to
    bolster an idea involving ethos, logos, pathos, and/or kairos.

Teachers can mention them in student conferences:

    For example, a teacher can talk to a student in a meeting about the
    argument paper on how to strengthen her thesis statement and avoid
    logical fallacies using the advice from the “Argument” module.

And teachers can ask students to reflect on them both during and after
major papers or projects. See below for a couple of reflective ideas:

    **Daily Write example** *– “Reflect for about five minutes on how
    the ‘Evaluating keys to successful analysis’ module has impacted how
    you constructed your thesis on the analysis paper. How is this
    significant in your understanding of college-level analytical
    writing? Why does this matter in terms of your growth as a writer
    and learner?”*

    **Part of a Unit Reflection example** *– “How did the Lumen Waymaker
    modules that you completed during this unit impact your work and/or
    your approach to the assignment? Why does this matter?”*

`Teaching WRIT 100 and WRIT 101 with Lumen
Waymaker <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/waymaker>`__

The Lumen modules address three issues in our Writing 100/101 classes:
students’ varied levels of preparation for college writing; the limited
means of assessment in composition courses; and the expense and
generalized nature of copyrighted textbooks and courseware.  

We know from the annual *Condition of College and Career Readiness
Report* (2016, 2017, 2018) that less than ⅔  of ACT-tested high school
graduates meet ACT college readiness English benchmarks and less than ½
 meet reading benchmarks. Percentages are even lower for
African-American and Hispanic students. Several studies (Pane et. a.l,
2015; Kiang et. al., 2016) have suggested that personalized learning
tools can improve college readiness. The Lumen modules focus on the
foundational rhetorical strategies and concepts first-year students need
to meet the demands of college writing. Students use the modules in ways
that suit their level of preparation. Some modules may serve as review
of foundational knowledge while others introduce learners to new
material and provide opportunities for practice.   

The essay is the standard means of assessment in composition courses,
which is appropriate. But the composition of an essay demands a solid
grasp of foundational rhetorical concepts and facility with varied
rhetorical strategies. Drilling down into an  essay to pinpoint the
concepts and skills students are struggling with is difficult, both for
students and instructors. In *How Learning Works* (2010), Ambrose et.
al. note that “adding structure and support — also called instructional
scaffolding — to a practice activity in or out of class promotes
learning when it helps students practice the target skills at an
appropriate level of challenge” (132). The activities and quizzes in the
Lumen modules operate as part of the instructional scaffolding students
need to meet the challenges presented in a full-length essay or
multimodal project. Because work in the modules is self-paced and
quizzes can be taken more than once, students can work with a concept
until they understand it, demonstrate their learning, and be affirmed
for their knowledge, even if they cannot yet apply that concept in an
essay.

While many textbook companies offer personalized learning courseware,
those products are designed for mass audiences, protected by copyright,
and come with a high price tag. Because the content of the Lumen modules
was suggested and composed by DWR teaching faculty, it aligns closely
with UM’s first-year writing curriculum. As each module is an
independent entity, faculty can easily order and implement modules to
fit their individual course calendars. That close alignment and
flexibility frees instructors from having to mine generalized,
pre-packaged content for material relevant to their courses, and because
the content of the modules is OER, their cost is low.

`Teaching WRIT 100 and WRIT 101 with Lumen
Waymaker <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/waymaker>`__

UM students enter Writing 100/101 classes with wide-ranging levels of
exposure to rhetorical terms and strategies. The Lumen modules, now
known as \ *UM RhetLab*, are designed to level the playing field for
students by addressing the rhetorical content knowledge that DWR
teachers emphasize. The modules consist of pre-tests, short readings
with embedded activities, and end-of-module quizzes. Students work on
these modules mostly outside of class, using the personalized learning
features of the courseware to address their own needs and to take
ownership of their learning. In annual surveys, two-thirds of 100/101
students have reported that the modules have helped them with their
larger papers and projects. In this guide you will find best practices
for teaching and learning with the Lumen modules.

This guide is for first time instructors and was created in response to
suggestions by former instructors. It has three primary functions.

Assignment sheets, rubrics, and other materials will be in the
Assignment Library.

Handbook Replacement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because WRIT 102 no longer uses a handbook, we thought this guide would
be helpful to new instructors for collecting resources that they could
use in the classroom.

Two open educational resources that you can use in addition to this
guide.

-  `Marc Watkins's WRIT 102 OER
   Collection <https://courses.lumenlearning.com/englishcomp2kscopex92x2/>`__
-  `Excelsior OWL <https://owl.excelsior.edu/>`__

Troubleshooting Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The committee also drew on their experiences in the 102 classroom to
pull together a troubleshooting guide about areas we noticed that our
students consistently struggle with.

Class Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because new instructors sometimes find it challenging to pace out a
class meeting, we have created detailed class plans that should give you
a rough idea of how long different class activities might take. These
instructional guides are not mandatory; we invite you to modify any
materials based on your comfort and your learning goals for each class.

How to Use this Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Includes a weekly and daily calendar for both MWF and T/R classes. It
will also reference documents in the assignment library as well as links
to Open Educational Resources in `Excelsior
OWL <https://owl.excelsior.edu/>`__ and `Marc Watkins's WRIT 102 OER
Collection <https://courses.lumenlearning.com/englishcomp2kscopex92x2/>`__.

`WRIT 102 Teaching
Guide <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/writing/writ102>`__

It is advisable to give students specific instructions and deadlines for
their work on the modules. Like some students do with reading and other
homework, they might be tempted to not take the modules as seriously as
they should unless teachers make it clear that the rhetorical content
knowledge and other material contained in the modules is important to
their learning and to their class success. Teachers should inform and
remind students that the modules can take on average about an hour to
complete so they should budget their time appropriately (though many
students do complete the work in a shorter time). Additionally,
instructors should reinforce the fact that students can attempt the
quizzes more than once to help improve their scores. This may mean
students need to spend some additional time working.

Below are a few ideas for assigning the modules:

*For a M/W/F class, assign one or two modules on Monday or Tuesday of a
week, and require the work to be completed within seven days. For
example, assign the first two modules on Monday, the first day of class.
Make the due date the following Monday by class time. (Note: Some
teachers might want to list a due date/time that is earlier than class
time in case they want to look at the results in advance of the
meeting.)*

*For a T/TH class, assign two modules on Tuesday of a week and require
that one is completed by Friday and the other by the following Tuesday
before class time.*

*For any course, assign one module as the only homework and require it
be completed by the next class meeting.*

As noted previously, teachers may want to plan on using a few moments of
class time to discuss the modules after they are due in order to
emphasize their value in the course and make connections to the larger
assignments.

The Lumen Waymaker courseware integrates seamlessly with your Blackboard
course.

--------------

`Download the RhetLab Blackboard
Package <https://olemiss.box.com/shared/static/cm66k1fa09fu0np71prvddyzwgngnmur.zip>`__

--------------

Follow these instructions to import the package:

Import
~~~~~~

-  **Navigate** to your WRIT 100 or 101 Course > Packages and Utilities
   > Import Package/View Logs
-  Choose “\ **Import Package**\ ”, enter:

   -  **SELECT A PACKAGE:** Click Browse to locate the course package
   -  **SELECT COURSE MATERIALS**: Check the boxes for:

      -  “Content Areas”
      -  “Discussion Board”
      -  “Grade Center Columns and Settings”

-  **SELECT** “Submit”

Test
~~~~

-  In any course modules, open any of the links/pages and verify the
   content displays.
-  In any Module, open the **Study Plan** and select **Show What You
   Know** and verify the pre-test works and the Study Plan updates.
-  Return to any module and select **Quiz** and verify quiz works.
-  Open Grades and review that all graded items are connected to the
   Gradebook

Best Practices
--------------

-  If you use **course copy** to quickly generate your Blackboard
   environment from a previous semester's course, **do not copy the
   Lumen Package from the previous semester**. Make sure it is unchecked
   when you select the content to copy. Copying the package from one
   course to another breaks the LTI links between Waymaker and
   Blackboard.

-  Once the package has been imported, you can move and rename any of
   the Waymaker folders and links as if they were any other Blackboard
   content item (though if you use course copy, you'll have to remember
   where you put everything so you can remove it before copying).

-  Waymaker automatically creates Grade Center columns for each module
   quiz. By default, these columns are worth 20 points and are not
   assigned a category. We recommend you adjust the grade center columns
   as follows:

   -  **Hide** the Waymaker columns from student view. They see their
      scores when they complete each quiz; generating a Blackboard
      notification each time they take a quiz tends to make them more
      concerned about grades than they should be.

   -  Assign the columns to a **category** that corresponds to how they
      are weighted in your syllabus. If you combine the quizzes with
      other homework, just make sure your homework columns are in the
      same category as the quizzes.

   -  Consider keeping the category with the Waymaker quizzes out of the
      course grade calculation until the end of the semester. This can
      help with grade anxiety.

Providing effective feedback is an ongoing challenge in the writing
classroom and there are a number of scholarly essays that explore this
area. Novice writers often resist revision. You will find that students
may change surface level errors when pointed out and will seem unwilling
or unable to change deeper, global concerns. Part of this resistance is
seeing first draft as “last draft.” I often tell students that good
writing seems like no effort at all and so students strive for a perfect
first draft without understanding the process that went into it. You can
then imagine that they often feel like failed writers because their
first drafts are so weak (the essay, “Shitty First Drafts,” might help
alleviate this approach). Students will probably also not understand a
number of your comments and will look at the feedback you provide as a
code to be deciphered in order to “give what the teacher wants.” Be
mindful of this as you leave comments on the paper and try to be
consistent in what you say, referencing terms and lessons from class (to
create a shared vocabulary).

It’s always good to give some kind of feedback on student writing during
the process. You can do a full draft with comments or you can spotcheck
different areas like thesis, introduction, etc. During the research
paper, however, you should conference with students and review a draft,
checking for issues with sources. This a good time to review the draft
for any potential plagiarism problems.

The style of commenting may depend on the needs of the student. Some
students will need more directive comments (specific suggestions for how
to revise a sentence or paragraph) to help them improve. Others thrive
on facilitative comments (open-ended questions to get the student
thinking about their paper). Some are overwhelmed with the number of
comments while others like a lot. You might consider asking students for
what kind of comments they like.

Consider this question when commenting on student papers: What was the
student trying to achieve and how can my comment help them achieve that?
Focus on your student as a writer.

Good practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Make the reading of comments be a reflective practice. Students often
   receive their graded papers and then do not read the comments. In
   fact, Underwood & Tregidgo (2006) recommend that grades and comments
   be given separately. Students see comments as a justification for the
   grade rather than help with future writing situations. These authors
   offer a number of good practices in their conclusion.
2. Students like positive comments, and it has been shown that such
   comments make students feel better about writing in general. Their
   writing, however, does not show much improvement. In summative
   comments, it’s a good idea to provide a good comment that
   acknowledges their work.

Guide <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/writing/writ102>`__

Writing is personal and can make us feel vulnerable so students will
often view your grading as highly subjective (and may also see it as a
comment on how you feel about them). So, it’s important to provide and
reference some kind of grading rubric throughout the writing process.
There are rubrics provided for each assignment that align with WRIT 102
learning outcomes. You may modify them, but keep in mind the goals for
each assignment as you do.

Introduce rubrics early, perhaps in conjunction with a sample paper.
Have students use the rubric to assess the writing.  Make it clear
throughout the writing process the areas you will be assessing
specifically for the assignment and model this through a sample paper.
Always give a copy of the rubric (printed or digital) to the student in
addition to the feedback (though these do not have to be delivered at
the same time).

It’s important to return papers with feedback as soon as you can. Aim
for a week after you have received the paper but not more than two
weeks. Students will need the feedback to help them with their current
writing task. If you find you are spending too much time on papers, how
much feedback are you leaving?

WRIT 102 is a fast-paced class. It is tempting to spend more time on the
analysis and synthesis units as some students will still struggle with
these concepts. However, you will need a full month for students to work
on the research paper and the last projects -- the multimodal and final
epilogue reflection -- should be given sufficient instruction and
process time. It’s the experience of the WRIT 102 curriculum committee
that assigned readings will occur more frequently in the first half of
the class; the second half of the semester will focus on the students’
research and writing. You may find that you aren’t assigning much from
the textbook at this point.  Below is a recommendation for how many
class periods to devote to each unit.

Pacing of the individual class sessions
---------------------------------------

If you don’t have a lot of experience running a classroom, one element
that will take time to become comfortable with experience is
understanding how long activities will take in a class.  Aim for two
activities in a 50 minute period and 3 activities in a 75 minute period.
Your mileage will vary, of course, depending on the class personality.
It’s important to mix up the activities to keep students fresh and
attentive. Sitting for a 50 minute lecture is nobody’s idea of fun. Mix
up the time with presentations, videos, group work, in-class drafting
and reflective writing. The calendars in the assignment library will
give you some idea of how you can structure a class.

There are two ways that students can pay for the Lumen Waymaker modules.
The first is to purchase an access code at the campus Barnes & Noble
bookstore. The second is a direct pay option using either a debit or
credit card. For either payment method, students will need to access the
Lumen Waymaker modules through the tab on your course Blackboard page.
From there, students will see two folders for each module: one a “Study
Plan” and the other a “Quiz.” The content, or “Study Plan,” is made up
of open educational resources (OER), so there is no payment option when
accessing this material.

The quiz assessments are where students will be asked to enter payment.
When students attempt to access any of the Lumen module quizzes, they
will see a “Course Assessment Activation” screen where they will have
three options: enter an access code purchased from the bookstore, pay
directly using a debit or credit card, or use one of two free passes to
take a quiz at the present time and pay later. **(Note: the direct pay
option using a debit or credit card is the cheaper option as there is no
bookstore markup involved.)** Finally, if a teacher feels like a student
isn’t completing quizzes because of a problem affording the materials
for the class, the instructor can contact the DWR’s Instructional
Designer for assistance.

Some teachers may experience low completion rates or poor work. In these
cases, it is important to communicate with your students before a
pattern is established. If a teacher assigns the first module or two and
many students don’t complete the work, make an announcement in class
reminding students that the modules are designed to help them build up
their knowledge and that they count for a significant portion of the
final grade. Or, talk to students individually and let them know you are
reviewing all the work in the class. Whatever the case, do not ignore
the problem. All students – but especially first-year students – can
benefit from a reminder that someone is accounting for their work.

If a teacher feels like the work on the modules is poor or substandard
on a class level, emphasize again that students can take quizzes two
times. And remember that teachers have the ability to grant extra
attempts at quizzes for any student by going into the given quiz on
Blackboard, then clicking “Manage Quiz Attempts,” finding the particular
student or students, and choosing the number of extra attempts.

`Teaching WRIT 100 and WRIT 101 with Lumen
Waymaker <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/waymaker>`__

All of the individual quiz questions in the Waymaker courseware are tied
to an identified skill, which in turn is linked to a learning objective.
Learning objectives are linked to module outcomes, which are themselves
linked to course outcomes. Thus, each individual quiz question is
connected in some way to a production-based learning outcome in WRIT
100/101. One concern faculty may have about the courseware is that the
quizzes are only valid assessments of module content knowledge and that
there is no substantive relationship between module content knowledge
and writing skill. However, if we accept the validity of our course
outcomes, as measured with rubric-based assessment of student writing,
we must also accept the validity of these quiz questions as a measure of
essential rhetorical skills.

This question appears in the analysis module quiz:

*Which of the following best describes how evidence should function in
an analytic writing?*

Here is the full skill map for this question:

All of the skills and objectives in the courseware target the first two
levels of Bloom’s taxonomy. If we accept the validity of Bloom’s
taxonomy, foundational knowledge and comprehension are prerequisite for
application, which is in turn prerequisite for analysis, evaluation, and
other higher-order knowledge work. Students cannot **analyze texts** in
their own writing until they can **evaluate** keys to successful
analysis. In order to evaluate, they must first **recognize** those
keys.

.. figure:: images/Bloom’s_Taxonomy_Verbs-1024x784.png
   :alt: 

Bloom's Taxonomy Verbs

When we evaluate student writing, we base our assessment on an
application of learning objectives from the top three tiers of Bloom’s
Taxonomy: Evaluation, Synthesis, and Analysis. For example, when we
decide if a student’s thesis statement is “supported by sound reasons”
or if it “demonstrates awareness of the depth of the issue,” we’re
looking at the student’s application of higher-order critical thinking
skills. Are they able to construct a logical thesis that is supported by
the right mix of evidence which targets a specific time and an
identified audience?

Does assessing higher-order skills necessarily tell us about a student’s
lower-order skills? If a student cannot construct a thesis statement
with sound reasons, can we know conclusively that it’s because he or she
doesn’t understand logical fallacies? In the strictest sense, we cannot
know. The instrument of assessment-- our rubric-- is not a valid measure
of the lower-order skills. It’s only a valid assessment of the criteria
it explicitly measures.

Since students have gaps in knowledge or other significant preparation
barriers coming in to college writing, it is important that we know
where those gaps are. Assessing lower-order skills does not detract from
our ability to teach and evaluate higher-order skills. A concern we hear
about the courseware is that the quizzes just do not relate to the work
the students are actually doing in class. This perception is not
accurate: every quiz question in the modules aligns to specific skills,
objectives, and learning outcomes. They target the three lower tiers of
Bloom’s taxonomy. This is by design: when we designed the courseware, we
wanted to focus on lower-order skills. We already know that student
writing itself is the best way to measure high-order skills. Nobody
would try to replace reading and responding to student writing with
multiple choice quizzes. Rather, these modules serve to measure skills
that we were not otherwise looking at explicitly. Previously, we
assessed this foundational rhetorical knowledge through assumption and
guesswork. All the quizzes do is provide actual data about how students
understand basic rhetorical skills.

Take a look at the chart below. It breaks down one of the WRIT 100/101
rubric categories into specific outcomes and traces how the courseware
skills align to those outcomes. Notice how the rubric targets the top of
Bloom’s taxonomy while the courseware skills target the bottom.

Classroom Management
--------------------

-  Although students are very proficient at using SnapChat and
   Instagram, they may not be able to submit an assignment to the
   correct submission box on Blackboard. It's worth spending two minutes
   of class to show them exactly where to submit each major assignment.
-  Many international students may not know how to paraphrase
   appropriately but are usually aware of this weakness. Some domestic
   students may not know how to paraphrase either but are more prone to
   think that practicing this skill is a waste of time. Explaining your
   rationale for repeating something that students may or may not have
   learned in high school may increase their motivation for completing
   activities like this.
-  Students may be vocal about their frustrations with class activities
   and grades during class, which is not an ideal time to have a
   discussion about such matters. To avoid this, consider adding a
   clause in your syllabus expressing that you value their
   thoughts/opinions/suggestions/questions about grades and activities
   but to come to your office if they'd like to have discussions about
   these topics.
-  College students still use the “my dog ate my homework” excuse, but
   now it’s the “I left my homework in my dorm” excuse. You don't have
   to make an exception to accept late work for this excuse.
-  There will always be one or two students who come to office hours
   every time you offer them. These students either want you to do
   everything for them or are “straight A” students who have a question
   about a comma.
-  Have an activity/assignment or two ready to post to BB or send to a
   colleague in case an emergency prevents you from attending class on
   short notice. You could have a "back-pocket" activity/assignment for
   each theme or could have a few "general" back-pocket activities such
   as creating effective titles, practice with citations, etc.
-  You probably care more about some students’ progress than they do.
   Try to find a balance between "hand-holding" and teaching them to be
   responsible.

WRIT 102 Units
--------------

-  **Analysis:** Even though students completed an analysis assignment
   in 100/101, some students may still think the first assignment is a
   summary. It's helpful to have a "summary vs. analysis" day during
   this unit.
-  **Synthesis:** Spending a good bit of time looking at sample papers
   for the synthesis assignment is a good idea, as many students will
   think they understand the assignment description but may not.
-  **Research:** As tempting as it may be, you can’t try to talk about
   every bit of a paper in a 15-minute conference.
-  **Multimodal:** This assignment doesn’t have to be complicated.
-  **CPB:** Ensuring that you save enough time at the end of class for
   CPB posts or that you begin classes with these will reinforce the
   value of reflection and will also lead to fewer missed posts on the
   CPB. Be sure that you emphasize that this is a semester-long project
   at the beginning of the semester.

As a rule, DWR classes should not be regularly canceled. However, there
are unavoidable emergencies, such as instructor illness, that sometimes
require classes to be cancelled. Occasionally, longer-term disruptions
in the academic calendar can occur. In either case, DWR faculty should
be prepared to move in-progress courses online, either in part or in
their entirety. This guide provides policies, best-practices, and
resources to reduce any disruption to student learning that may occur.

2021 Call for Proposals \| Teaching and Learning in the “New Normal”
--------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the objectives in the DWR’s 2018-2022 Strategic Plan is to
“Support Faculty and Staff Development and Promote Teaching Excellence.”
To support continuous improvement and professional development for our
faculty, the department is pleased to welcome proposals for Summer 2021
Professional Development Mini-Grants.

This year’s grants will fund teacher-to-teacher knowledge building and
professional development instead of large-scale revisions to DWR
courses. One of the things the pandemic highlighted is the critical
roles community building and professional development play in sustaining
good pedagogy and teacher growth. Despite the difficult circumstances of
the last year, the few teacher-led workshops that took place had broader
attendance and greater engagement than ever before. As the teaching and
learning environment returns to “normal” in Fall 2021, it is important
to hold on to and share what we learned.

In that spirit of sharing, we welcome grant applicants to propose
workshops with accompanying resource collections that facilitate
teacher-to-teacher knowledge building. These workshops would be
scheduled for Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 with two primary goals:

1. To start conversations and inspire discussions among colleagues about
   innovations in pedagogy, educational technology, and scholarship.
2. To collect and curate resources to advance collective knowledge and
   inspire others in the future.  

Interested faculty are invited to apply for a Course Enhancement
Mini-Grant to propose a workshop or similar event to take place during
the 2021-2022 academic year. Workshop topics may include (but are not
limited to):

-  Evaluation and discussion of a digital teaching tool
-  Guided discussion of scholarship
-  Demonstration of an assignment, activity, or course unit
-  Presentation of ongoing research related to teaching and learning
-  Introduction of a community-based project related to the work of the
   DWR

Successful grant applicants will receive \ **$400 in development funds**
and exclusive time and support from the DWR Instructional Designer,
Andrew Davis.

--------------

Application Information
-----------------------

Interested faculty should submit a grant application by **May 3, 2021.**
The application form contains the following sections:

1. Presentation/Workshop Category

   -  Technology
   -  Pedagogy

All online DWR courses are reviewed by experienced online faculty using
a common evaluation rubric. The rubric was adapted from the Division of
Outreach's online review program and customized to the needs of DWR
faculty and the realities of the courses we teach.

The rubric is divided into 5 categories. There are several evaluation
criteria within each category. Reviewers will also provide narrative
feedback for each category as well as summary comments at the end of the
review.

Faculty will receive a copy of each online course review for inclusion
in FARS.

Rubric Criteria Checklist
-------------------------

This checklist explains what online course reviewers look for for each
of the rubric criteria.

Corequisite Writing 100 combines the DWR’s introductory course to
academic writing, Writing 100, with a corequisite course, designed to
support students’ work in Writing 100 while simultaneously fulfilling
the DS 98 requirement.  Corequisite Writing 100 meets five days per
week, with Writing 100 scheduled on M/W/F and the corequisite course
scheduled on T/Th. Upon successful completion of the course, students
move into Writing 102 or Liberal Arts 102.

About the Corequisite Courses
-----------------------------

The corequisite course mirrors the sequence of Writing 100 with a focus
on drafting and revising the major projects as well as journaling,
discussing readings, working in small groups, and examining ways to
improve writing.

The grade for the corequisite course is comprised equally of attendance,
preparation, participation, and the journal.

|Writing and Rhetoric Opening Session: Learning to Navigate the New
Terrain|\ This year's DWR Opening Session will combine live meetings
with asynchronous, on-demand workshops. In addition to a full faculty
meeting at 9:00 on Thursday August 20, we'll have a few special-interest
meetings at 10:00 and an optional social "Happy Hour" gathering at 4:00.

The "on-demand" workshops will be available the entire week starting on
Monday August 17. In addition to the workshop videos themselves (hosted
as Panopto videos), each session has a dedicated Teams channel for
ongoing discussion and Q&A. Just follow the "Join Teams Channel" link
for the session.

Even though we won't gather in person for Opening Session, feel free to
visit the "Break Room" Teams channel any time during the week to say
hello to your colleagues. We are encouraging everyone to try using Teams
to stay in touch with DWR colleagues. The Break Room can act as a
substitute for the informal, off-topic chat that usually happens before
Opening Session and between individual sessions. Though there are no
delicious breakfast foods this time, we hope you'll say hello anyway.

*Prepared by Desiree Hensley, Associate Professor of Law and Director of
the Housing Clinic at The University of Mississippi School of Law, this
letter, which may be distributed to students, contextualizes the issue
of fair housing in our University, local, and state communities.*

Welcome to the University of Mississippi and to Oxford! We hope you are
settling into your new campus home and town and will have a great first
year of college. Everything is almost certainly going to go according to
plan, or even better. We’re sure you will love your classes, make new
friends, grow as a student and scholar, and have a fun and conflict-free
academic year, especially with the University of Mississippi as your
landlord. We think it’s only fair to warn you, however, that conflicts
may occur when you reside on campus, and if they do you may be up the
proverbial “creek.” Or, maybe not a creek, exactly, but at a place where
you are without the statutory rights and protections promised to other
renters and tenants in the State.

Mississippi law is not very protective of renters in general, but in
most cases (not all) it does at least require a landlord to prove in
court that he or she is entitled to evict a renter and always prohibits
a landlord from using violence or threats to kick out a renter. What
this means is that in some scenarios a landlord may change tenants’
locks or shut off their electricity but can’t threaten tenants with a
weapon or beat them up while doing it. Rest assured, Ole Miss will not
threaten you with a weapon. But it may be able to change your locks.
(Note to self: Have you read your housing agreement with the
University?)

Also, Mississippi law usually requires a landlord to maintain the rental
home in a decent condition and provides a way for the tenant to get out
of the lease when the landlord is not maintaining the property. Water is
leaking into your room from the room above yours? The law requires your
landlord to fix that. The lock on your room is broken? Call the
landlord. Have mold? Landlord, please fix it. Your air conditioning is
broken? Landlord on the way. Unfortunately, however, the Mississippi
legal requirements that obligate a landlord to maintain a tenant’s home
are difficult to enforce, and—apologies!—don’t apply to tenants like you
(University students living in a dorm), so good luck getting your dorm
room fixed (at least as soon as you would like). (Aside: I’m sure the
University means well and will take care of your needs as soon as
possible. But if not, there’s not much you can do about it.)

Mississippi law also says that a landlord must give a tenant written
notice that the tenant has violated a rule in the lease, and then must
wait 30 days before evicting the tenant. The reason? To give the tenant
time to stop violating the lease so that the tenant can continue to live
there. We know you would never violate dorm rules and are not interested
in late parties, alcohol, having overnight visitors, listening to loud
music, or putting signs in your windows. So, no worries there. Just in
case you do violate a dorm rule, however minor, you should know that
state law doesn’t require that the University give you any notice before
it evicts you. (Aside: Please read your agreement about what happens if
you violate the lease. Just a heads up!)

It’s no joke that college is expensive and would be unaffordable for
many of you but for student loans. In Mississippi, if your rent is late
the landlord can evict you just three days after providing written
notice that you better pay or get out. Three days is much too short for
most people to come up with the missing rent, especially when there’s no
money left until the next paycheck. As a student, most of you are not
getting a weekly paycheck. For many of you, your “paycheck” is your
once-a-semester student loan. Imagine trying to 1) find a new place to
live; 2) pack up; and 3) physically move out within three days while
going to class, preparing for tests, writing papers, or taking care of a
family. Three days to completely uproot your entire life is an
impossible and stressful situation to be in for anyone. For students,
eviction often leads to dropping out of school until the student is able
to become financially stable again.

Finally, please try to avoid becoming homeless—either on campus or in
Oxford. You will be removed by campus police if you sleep on campus and
are not a currently enrolled student. The Oxford police will offer you
the choice of either going to the Lafayette County detention center or
being dropped off outside of the city limits. Interfaith Compassion
Ministry has a limited number of vouchers it can provide qualified
Oxonians for three nights at the Ole Miss Motel on University Avenue,
but that is essentially the only resource available to you. The HUD
vouchers described by Matthew Desmond in *Evicted*? There are none
available here. And last year the City of Oxford chose to demolish 100
units of federally subsidized housing for Oxford citizens most in need
of housing that the City could have refurbished or rebuilt with federal
and state funding.

The good news is that if you do end up in a housing situation that is
unfair or unjust, there is always “The Law.” Just go to the Square and
hire a lawyer to force your landlord to follow the terms of the lease or
the law. Just joking. This really never happens. It’s way too expensive
for most renters to hire a lawyer to help them, and it’s very, very hard
for a tenant to get free legal help. In Mississippi the ratio of lawyers
who provide free legal services to low-income people who need these
services is 1:18,000. The main local provider is North Mississippi Rural
Legal Services in Oxford. You can find their 1-800 number online. The
University of Mississippi School of Law also has a Low-Income Housing
Clinic that educates law students by providing free legal services to UM
students and the community regarding housing issues on a first-come,
first served basis. You can apply for the Clinic’s legal services by
calling 662-915-3493 during the academic year.

Even if you get a lawyer to help you fight an eviction, you are likely
to lose. Mississippi’s court system assigns eviction matters to the
Justice Court. There are over 82 separate Justice Courts in the State—at
least one, sometimes two, per county. Each court has its own judge who
runs the courtroom and interprets the laws differently. This is
especially problematic because anyone with a high school diploma is
qualified to be elected as a Justice Court judge in Mississippi. Most
have no formal legal training whatsoever and regularly get the law
wrong. Many have no idea about the complex personal, legal, financial,
and health problems caused by the system of easy evictions that
Mississippi and most other places in the United States have today.
Appeals are expensive, and, in any event, just because someone appeals a
Justice Court’s decision to enforce an eviction doesn’t mean that the
eviction is “paused”—it isn’t.

I think you get the picture. Being a renter here at the University, in
Oxford, in the United States in general, means that you are subject to
forces that are, in many ways, beyond your control. Even when you have a
right to be treated a certain way, enforcement of those rights is not a
given and difficult, at best. Adding to the mix, being in poverty,
experiencing an unexpected financial strain, suffering from physical or
mental disabilities, dealing with drug or alcohol addiction, being the
caregiver for rambunctious children, or even being a member of a
minority group—all compound the problem. What can you do about it? Elect
state representatives who will enact tenant-protective laws and reform
the courts; elect federal representatives who will fund new
publicly-owned, affordable housing units and HUD vouchers; elect local
officials who will not demolish public housing, but who will fight to
preserve and improve it. Advocate at your University for a Student Bill
of Rights that protects you when you are a tenant in campus housing and
when you move off campus into privately owned and managed housing.
Volunteer at North Mississippi Rural Legal Services. Become an advocate.
Become a lawyer.

*A Note for Instructors*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chapter 2 is written by University of Mississippi Associate Professor of
Law Desiree Hensley, a legal scholar and tireless advocate for fair
housing policies. Her “Open Letter to New Tenants” is at times
provocative, informative, funny, and satirical. Professor Hensley wants
our students to view themselves as tenants, perhaps for the first time,
and to thereby better relate to some of the individuals profiled in
Evicted. Sharing her letter would be a great way to lead students on an
imaginative journey, to get them thinking critically about themselves,
the book, and our collective world.

If you choose to use Hensley’s letter, remind your students that the
exercise is an imaginative one. In reality, the university provides
policies and rights over and above the legal minimums of Mississippi. If
your first-year students have questions about campus living, they can
always contact a staff member from the Department of Student Housing at
(662) 915-7328. These campus housing professionals are eager to help and
support students. Thankfully, as Hensley notes, our students don't have
to navigate the tricky legalities of being a tenant alone. Unlike many
Americans, our students have certain privileges, supports, and
responsibilities. Student Housing does not simply change locks nor evict
students for minor policy violations, and the Student Housing website
offers information, contact channels, and a digital "Maintenance
Request" form for reporting maintenance issues.

Student Housing works hard to support and advocate for students and
provides living and learning environments that support student success.
And, as students move beyond their first year, Ole Miss continues to
provide apartments and residence hall options for sophomores, juniors,
and seniors to continue their academic success and have a home away from
home.

Discussing the letter with students might even be an opportunity to make
sure students know whom to contact if they do have any issues or
concerns with their living spaces or want to learn more about leadership
and academic opportunities in campus housing.

Use the form below to contribute a new assignment to the DWR Teaching
Hub's Assignment Library. Your proposal will go to the respective
curriculum committee for further review.

The TPEG model is developed for small groups of instructors who want to
collaborate on a solution to an instructional issue and use observations
to record their endeavors and outcomes. The following five-step process,
inspired by the PRO-Teach and TPEG models, may be used by any
instructional group, including self-declared, teaching circles, or
committees.

1. **Form TPEG**: Teaching Peer Excellence Groups of three to five
   members form to address a specific curricular or instructional issue
   and create methods/materials/lessons/activities as a response or
   solution to the issues.
2. **Pilot Solution(s)**: Once developed, the group members pilot
   work(s) in their classrooms (i.e., methods, materials, lessons,
   activities).
3. **Observe Pilot**: Each TPEG member implementing the
   response/solution into the classroom will be observed by another
   member of the TPEG during the pilot or testing phase. The purpose of
   the observation will be to collect and document information,
   including a `teaching
   observation <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/observations/f2f/tpeg/report/>`__
   and `student
   survey <https://olemiss.box.com/s/66di2ox3csuxfczv7eqwrn87t2lg49a1>`__.
   The visiting instructor will administer the student survey, either
   online or at the end of the class (while the instructor of record
   leaves the room).
4. **Discuss Results**: After all observation(s) are complete, TPEG
   members summarize student survey results, discuss observations, and
   determine next steps. The
   `reflection <https://olemiss.box.com/s/uuelybkv6lhs9hl2o8jh3goap8c2641f>`__
   for this phase may be submitted with your Faculty Activity Report.
5. **Report Teacher Observation through Teaching Hub**: TPEG
   observations may satisfy DWR `observation
   requirements <http://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/observations/f2f/tpeg/report/>`__
   as well, though participants are not required to submit TPEG
   observation reports if the observation requirement is met by other
   means.

The cycle may take one to three semesters to complete. For a more
detailed explanation, see the `PRO/TPEG
handout <https://olemiss.box.com/s/gsjxaqp8ehu8pm3re6n8pt05a0rhfd2e>`__.

Faculty interested in joining a TPEG to fulfill their annual
professional development should appoint a group "leader" for
administrative purposes and submit the form below.

Course Description
------------------

This course introduces students to the contemporary history of and
various trends within writing studies, with a particular focus on
composition theories prevailing from roughly 1960 to the present.
Students first examine the historical events that helped shape
composition classrooms before exploring a variety of theoretical
approaches to understanding and teaching writing. The course engages
students in analysis, comparison and contrast, classification,
reflection, and argument n a variety of assignments, including written,
oral, and multimodal projects. Students conclude the semester with an
argumentative exploration of their own position(s) within the
theoretical fields of writing studies in terms of understanding their
own writing histories and possible futures as well as a final reflection
about their growth as writers and theorists of composition throughout
the course.

The course emphasizes understanding contemporary composition theories in
order to situate students’ writing experiences within those theories and
to guide their writing pedagogy.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

-  Develop an understanding of contemporary composition theories, their
   use in writing instruction, and their impact on writing experiences
   for the secondary classroom.
-  Recognize, through comparison, contrast, and classification, the ways
   in which composition theories overlap and diverge;
-  Analyze prior writing experiences in order to identify and explore
   their theoretical context(s); and practical application
-  Evaluate current theoretical approaches in order to develop a
   coherent personal composition pedagogy for secondary classrooms.
-  Develop an understanding of aspects of the writing process with a
   focus on secondary instruction.

Upper-division WRIT courses that are a part of the Minor in Professional
Writing and/or the B.A. in Rhetoric are more specialized and less
standardized than lower-division courses. Individual faculty members
assert more ownership over these courses and there are often several
iterations of each one. The Upper Division assignment library is
designed to capture as many of these variations as possible and provide
interested faculty plenty of ideas and resources if they are teaching
the course for the first time.

One of the objectives in the DWR’s 2018-2022 Strategic Plan is to
“Support Faculty and Staff Development and Promote Teaching Excellence.”
DWR course enhancement grants are available to support continuous
improvement and professional development for our teaching faculty. In
Spring 2020, several of the grant workshops were held online. The
recordings of these workshops are available below.

--------------

**Presenter:** Carrie McCormick

**Title**: “Popculture Podcast” – A Scaled Assignment to Create Group
Engagement and Focus on Vocalitics

**Description**: This three project scaled assignment focused on the
efficient encoding of messages along a channel as well as prompting
earlier group formation and engagement in the online environment. The
students analyzed a podcast, created an individual podcast, and then
lastly created a group podcast. Students were specifically instructed to
pay attention to and analyze their vocalics, and they completed
reflections of their performances at each step along the way to create
awareness of their own speaking styles and abilities.

**Presenter:** Kerry Bowers

**Title**: Adventures in Dogfooding: Research, Recalibration, and the
Writing Process

**Description**: This presentation discusses the results of a research
project involving dogfooding, a recursive pedagogical practice that
advocates having instructors complete their own assignments. The project
involved completing the full sequence of assignments comprising the
coursework in Advanced Composition. The process not only produced a
current set of models, but also provided valuable insights for improving
pedagogy and recalibrating instruction.

**Presenter:** LaToya Faulk

**Title**: Using Writing to Fix What’s Broken: A Rhetorical Genre
Studies & Social Problem-Solving Approach to Teaching First Year Writing

**Description**: This pedagogical undertaking investigates the impact of
a centralized genre knowledge curriculum where students applied
understanding of ethnography as a functional disciplinary genre in the
social sciences to their critical understanding of Matthew Desmond’s
Evicted. Students were asked to reiterate the genre features of
Desmond’s work by creating several major writing tasks which sought to
foster an awareness of the real mechanisms of genre features while
satisfying QEP and learning outcome demands. Students first analyzed
Desmond’s Evicted, then wrote a social problem narrative which used
community discourse and first-hand interviews to vocalize a chosen issue
within society that concerned them; next, an I-Search paper was assigned
to help students foster deeper understandings of the social problem by
consulting primary, secondary, scholarly, and popular sources. Once
sources were consulted, students wrote a proposal argument that used the
social problem narrative and source material to introduce practical
solutions to the social problem attended to throughout the course of the
term. Lastly, an infographic which informs community members through
visual representation of the issue and proposed solution was crafted by
students. This workshop will walk you through assignment details and
share student writing samples as a way to shed light on the affordances
and drawbacks of the applied curriculum.

**Presenter:** Claire Mischker

**Title**: Revising the Editing Class: Curating OER Resources to Enhance
Writing 370

**Description**: In our catalog, Writing 370 is titled “Editing and
Proofreading in Professional Contexts” and has historically focused on
rhetorical grammar. This presentation addresses the organization of OER
resources collected in pursuit of lower cost (free!) class materials
that reconcile more appropriately with the course’s revised assignments,
learning outcomes, and focus—all three of which will be briefly
discussed. I will also suggest directions for further development of
enhanced resources for Writing 370.

In Fall 2020, DWR faculty and staff will work partially or entirely
remotely for the semester. This will require us to be successful remote
colleagues, in addition to being successful remote teachers. This page
is meant to provide some resources for staying productive and sane while
we're away from campus. For remote teaching best-practices, visit our
`Academic Continuity
Guide. <https://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/guides/continuity/>`__

The DWR Remote Teaching Task Force is committed to support all DWR
faculty, regardless of their teaching modality. We are encouraging all
faculty and staff to use `Microsoft
Teams <https://teams.microsoft.com/>`__ to keep in touch with each other
and the administrative team. We're all pretty familiar with Zoom at this
point, and Teams is a lot more than just video calling. Teams has
reduced the volume of email for 12-month faculty and staff who have
relied on the platform this summer.

Though you can access Teams in a web browser, we recommend you `download
the
application <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app>`__
for your computer and mobile device. Remember to sign into Teams with
your UM Office365 email address and password.

**Discussion Questions** (adapted from *Rhode Island Center for the Book
2019 Resource Guide*, BGSU *Library Guide*, and the Random House *Common
Reading Guide*)

--------------

1. Throughout the book, Hanna-Attisha references Iraqi cultural ideas
   and customs that influence her family. Describe the ways that her
   family hews to these traditional values and the ways that they don’t.
   How do Hanna-Attisha’s choices to embrace or reject certain cultural
   values shape her life?

--------------

2. How do Hanna-Attisha’s childhood experiences at school reflect the
   common challenges and experiences of first-generation immigrants?
   Does her life experience reflect the idea of America as a “mosaic” or
   a “melting-pot”?

--------------

3. In Chapter 7, Hanna-Attisha notes that the government’s involvement
   in protecting the public is relatively recent. How involved should
   the government (local, state, and federal) be in ensuring public
   health and safety, and what should be the role of individuals and
   community groups?

--------------

4. Marc Edwards, described on page 91 as the “warrior scientist” and a
   corrosion expert who helped publicize the Washington D.C. water
   crisis, plays a role in the Flint crisis as well. However, both
   Betzano and Hanna-Attisha are reluctant to work with him at first
   because of his “inflammatory” style. When is a confrontational and
   aggressive style beneficial to a cause, and when does it do more harm
   than good?

--------------

5. On pages 207 and 241, Hanna-Attisha explains the Arab concept of
   “aeb,” which means “shame.” She describes her fear of bringing shame
   to her family as a “tumor” that she cannot get rid of. What role do
   you think shame should play in a society, and are there any positive
   consequences to shaming other people or to fearing being shamed?

--------------

6. One of the hurdles faced by Hanna-Attisha is getting support from
   state and local elected officials like the mayor of Flint and
   Michigan congressional representatives and senators. Examine the
   roles played by these officials and their motives for supporting or
   ignoring the scientific findings about the water. Who is reluctant to
   publicize the findings, and why? Who supports publicizing the
   findings, and why? What does this suggest about the importance of
   public officials and the voters who elect them?

--------------

7. Even though the negative impacts of lead exposure have been apparent
   for hundreds of years, Hanna-Attisha’s claims about lead
   contamination in Flint’s water were initially denied by the
   government for months. What are similar instances throughout history
   where contamination or poisonings have been ignored? Why were they
   ignored instead of immediately acted upon and investigated?

--------------

8. Multiple factors influenced the ultimate lead poisoning in Flint’s
   tap water. How might these factors influence water quality in other
   cities around the country? Is this epidemic something that might
   continue to occur with America’s aging water infrastructure systems?

--------------

9. The Flint Water Crisis was not covered extensively in the media,
   beyond local outlets, until many months had passed. Why do you think
   that the story was not picked up by the national media?

--------------

10. There was lead discovered in the tap water in Washington D.C. in
2001. It took three years for the problem to be addressed, just as it
took much too long for the issue to be addressed in Flint. What factors
influenced the delay in action? Considering that Flint and Washington
D.C. are drastically different areas, what commonalities existed that
resulted in similar treatment of their lead contamination?

--------------

11. Hanna-Attisha writes, “We each have the power to fix things. We can
open one another’s eyes to problems. We can work together to create a
better, safer world” (13). How did Hanna-Attisha’s actions make a
difference in the community of Flint? Can you think of a time in your
own life when you have made other people aware of a problem that they
were not aware of? What do you believe you can do as an individual to
make the world a better and safer place?

--------------

12. During her pediatric residency, Hanna-Attisha first heard the
expression, “The eyes don’t see what the mind doesn’t know,” based on a
quote by D. H. Lawrence. Why are pediatricians trained to look beyond
what is immediately apparent? Describe a time in your own life when you
learned more about a situation once you looked beyond what was visible.
What action(s) did you take once you more fully understood the
situation? This quote is reflected in the title of the book. What are
the other meanings of the title?

--------------

13. What are adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and toxic stresses?
How can adversities like poverty, racism, and violence impact a child’s
development? Are you exposed to any toxic stresses in your current,
everyday environment? If you are, what can you do to counteract them?
How can recognition of the lifelong impact of toxic stresses change not
only how we treat adults with the consequences of toxic stresses, but
also the prevention of exposure to toxic stresses?

--------------

14. Why did Hanna-Attisha decide to teach her pediatric residents about
the history of racial injustice in the United States? What examples did
she share when teaching residents about the history of racism in medical
care? Why did she believe it was important for her residents to be made
aware of the city’s weaknesses and needs, while also fostering
solidarity with and empathy for Flint’s residents? How can pediatric
residents support and strengthen their communities?

--------------

15. Hanna-Attisha describes Flint as being in a “man-made state of
emergency for forty years” (128), with very high poverty rates, numerous
abandoned homes, and little incoming tax revenue. How did practices like
racist employment policies, housing segregation, and blockbusting
disproportionately affect black families? How did government policies
and deindustrialization play roles in the water crisis in Flint? Why did
Hanna-Attisha choose to work in Flint? How was she inspired by the
history of Flint and the roles of labor rights, workers, and
strikes—especially the women’s brigade strikers—in that history?

--------------

16. What was your reaction to the fact that, at the beginning of the
water crisis, Flint residents were paying some of the highest rates for
water in the country? How would this impact personal actions like the
recommended practice of flushing faucets? Why does Hanna-Attisha write
that, in the wake of the crisis, many Flint residents were suffering
from “communitywide PTSD” (323)? What do you think she meant by this?

--------------

17. How did the lack of corrosion control create additional problems in
Flint? How did you feel when you learned General Motors switched back to
Great Lakes’ water after noticing that engine parts were corroding? Why
do you think the county health department did not alert medical
providers or the public about the increase in cases of Legionnaires’
disease? Why do children face such a high risk of poisoning from
environmental lead exposure?

--------------

18. What complications did Hanna-Attisha and her team face as they
studied the blood lead level (BLL) data of children in Flint? How was
their study affected by factors like seasonality, age, and repeated
exposure to lead? Why is institutional review board (IRB) approval
important for a research study like this? How did Hanna-Attisha prepare
for the public release of her research?

--------------

19. Why was the data from Hurley an underestimation of exposure? Why was
it important to frame population-wide lead exposure as an additional
toxic stress in Flint? How can early interventions and continued
advocacy mitigate toxic stress and give children with lead poisoning the
best possible chance for recovery? What short- and long-term
interventions did Hanna-Attisha recommend for affected children? What
recommendations would you add to such a list of interventions?

--------------

20. What is the difference between treatment of individual health and
treatment of population health? How can lead exposure have drastic
impacts at the population level? How does lead exposure
disproportionately affect black people? Do you think it is ethical to
use children as detectors of environmental contamination? What is the
concept of primary prevention? What kind of policies and programs would
need to be adopted to practice primary prevention? How does
Hanna-Attisha’s identity as an Iraqi American woman not living in Flint
influence her actions? Can you think of a time that your own identity
affected how you dealt with a problem?

--------------

21. How did Saddam Hussein’s brutal and violent rule in Iraq affect
Hanna-Attisha and her family when she was growing up? How did learning
about relatives like Dr. Paul Shekwana and Nuri Rufail Koutani impact
Hanna-Attisha as an adult? She writes that she “understood that leaders
could be dangerous, that civilizations sat on the delicate edge of a
precipice, and that injustice must be challenged” (218-19). How did her
Iraqi immigrant family and social justice heritage impact her thinking?
How does this compare to your own thinking about government leaders?
What do you think it means to challenge injustice?

--------------

22. What is primacy? How does primacy between agencies like the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) affect situations like the Flint water
crisis? How do you think state and federal governments should work
together to manage environmental crises? Explain your reasoning.

--------------

23. What is environmental justice? How does lead exposure exacerbate
inequality and the racial education gap? What can residents do in their
daily lives to support environmental justice?

--------------

24. Hanna-Attisha was surprised to learn that Marc Edwards was a
conservative Republican, given how much they had in common. Why did she
assume that he was “a lefty activist” (235)? How might their political
differences affect how they worked together? Describe a time when you
have worked with someone who has different beliefs than you. What did
you learn from the experience?

--------------

25. How does Hanna-Attisha use storytelling to communicate the Flint
water crisis to the public? Why did she hold up a baby bottle filled
with water at her first press conference? How did Hanna-Attisha use her
personality characteristics and personal strengths to her advantage? How
was she inspired by Alice Hamilton’s advocacy? Describe a time that you
used your individual strengths to communicate or act on a problem.
Hanna-Attisha says, “I was also a scientist, an advocate, and now an
activist” (266). What do you think the difference is between “advocate”
and “activist”?

--------------

26. Why was lead added to gasoline, despite most of the world’s
rejection of lead due to its adverse health effects? How does the past
use of lead in gasoline continue to have an impact on the environment
today? Why does Hanna-Attisha refer to Dr. Charles Kettering as a
“public health villain” (146)? What is Kehoe’s Paradigm (also called the
Kehoe Rule)? How did it establish a new precedent that required public
health advocates to prove harm before action could be taken?

--------------

27. Hanna-Attisha describes the “real villains” in the Flint water
crisis as being “the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed,
anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism.
These are powerful forces most of us don’t notice, and don’t want to”
(14). Share your reactions to this opinion. How could the water crisis
have been prevented? What policies and practices do you think should be
put in place in order to prevent future crises?

--------------

28. What are the connections between Hanna-Attisha’s stories of Iraq and
those of the Flint water crisis? What is the purpose of family stories
like Haji and the Birds in the narrative? Are there morality tales from
your own family that you cherish and give you strength? What does
Hanna-Attisha mean by, “We step over complex systems every day, walking
through history and pretending darkness isn’t there” (72)?

--------------

29. In discussion about public health pioneer John Snow, Hanna-Attisha
says, “His work wasn’t about scientific discovery alone. It was about
people and community. That’s what science is supposed to be about—not an
academic exercise for the ivory tower, or racking up publications,
grants, and offers of tenure. It’s about using the tools and technology
available to make lives better, no matter what articles of faith
obstruct the path” (87). Share your reaction to this. What do you think
the purpose of science should be? What are the influences in science and
academia that threaten that purpose? How was Hanna-Attisha’s
presentation of her research before going through the peer review
process a form of academic disobedience? Do you recall a time in your
life where you did something that was against the norm but was the right
thing to do?

The WRIT 100/101 Blackboard template provides a pre-developed course
structure, major assignments, and grade center configuration for the
standard, NYT, and NPR curriculum options. It is designed to accommodate
fully-online, remote, and hybrid course modalities and is fully
customizable once added to a course. The Opening Session workshop,
below, provides a full walk-through of the template features. You should
watch this workshop session before you decide to adopt the template.

The template is designed to save you time and headaches and to provide a
consistent experience for students. If you would rather build your
Blackboard shell from scratch, you're free to do so.

Download the Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the Blackboard package using the button below. The package is a
.zip file, and you should not extract it. Some browsers (like Safari),
may extract the .zip file automatically, so if you see an extracted
folder, try downloading the package using a different browser.

`Download Blackboard
Package <https://olemiss.box.com/shared/static/9m7d3sm5gzw1o1rtcnd85tpxjmn68efz.zip>`__

If you would like to be added to the Blackboard sandbox for the template
instead of using the package, just contact `Andrew
Davis <https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=addavis@olemiss.edu>`__.
This is a good option if you only want to use certain parts of the
template.

This guide provides Department of Writing & Rhetoric (DWR) faculty
members with information about the Oxford to the Ballot Box project.
This guide provides:

-  An overview that details the project’s rationale and partners
-  General assignment ideas provided by the project advisory board
-  Topics for common assignments in DWR courses
-  Sample prompts and assignment sheets for various DWR courses
-  Incorporating tutorials from the project coordinators
-  Resources (e.g., readings, videos, films, websites, etc.)

As you design your curricula and materials for fall 2020, we hope that
you consider participating in the Oxford to the Ballot Box Project by
adapting an assignment or incorporating a new one that helps students
address the importance of and challenges related to voting. Some of your
students’ work from these assignments could be featured in online venues
and events that the project advisory board is developing.

If you decide to include an assignment related to the project in your
fall 2020 course(s), if you have any questions about incorporating
assignments into your class, please contact `Don
Unger <mailto:dunger@olemiss.edu>`__. If you have questions about the
overall project, please contact `Jon
Winet <mailto:jon-winet@uiowa.edu>`__ and `Allen
Spore <mailto:allenspore@gmail.com>`__.

**Title:** Essay Writing at The Sentence Level **Presenter:** LaToya
Faulk **April 29, 4:00 - 5:00 CDT** **Description**: Utilizing Nora
Bacon’s *The Well-Crafted Sentence: A Writer’s Guide to Style*, LaToya
Faulk's workshop will detail results from two in-class activities
implemented in WRIT 100 and WRIT 101 which emphasized attention to a
diversity of well-conceived sentence structures in the writing process.
Additional attention to voice, style, and tone—specifically as it
relates to both (1) helping students establish working writing
identities, and (2) analyzing the sentence structures of published
writers in order to compare and closely identity a multitude of voices,
styles, and tones which can then be emulated or drawn from in students'
own writing—were also implemented in the writing process as
developmental strategies to improve students' development of ideas at
the sentence level. Conclusively, this workshop will outline course
strategies while also provide an overview of scholarship supporting
pedagogical practices that encourage attention to voice and style as
elements of craft in the writing process.

**Title:** Making the Online Course a Welcoming Space for First-Year
Writing Students **Presenter:** Marc Watkins **April 12, 1:00 - 2:00
CDT** **Description**: The Course Enhancement Grant allowed Marc Watkins
to explore ways to make his Writ 102 online/ hybrid course more
welcoming and engaging to students. The goal was to transform the way
students viewed the syllabus through open-pedagogy policies so that they
no longer viewed the syllabus as a contract or “terms of service
agreement” that was static and ignorable. Instead, the syllabus became a
dynamic space in which students entered into conversation about their
learning and were empowered to engage with more fully. Additionally, he
revamped the student guide module to help students understand the
transition between a traditional and online/hybrid course. Students were
also invited to engage in experiential learning and developed a series
of student-created tutorials and guides to help future students
navigated challenges within the course.

**Title:** We're not in Kansas Anymore: Exploring Student Learning
through Video Discussions **Presenter:** Dr. Alice Myatt **March 25,
1:00 - 2:00 CDT** **Description**: Can a social networking tool like
Flipgrid foster community-building among vulnerable student populations
and thus aid success and retention in their academic work? Can video
discussions increase engagement and success among notoriously
underprepared Fall online WRIT 102 students? Dr. Alice Myatt’s 2020
Course Enhancement project integrated weekly video discussion
assignments designed to facilitate self-efficacy, exploration, and
reflection into her online WRIT 102 classes. Her workshop will highlight
the successes and the challenges this project posed during a chaotic
COVID semester and invite attendees to discuss ways to expand on the
project in the future.

**Title:** Toward an Antiracist Writing Assessment Ecology in First-Year
Writing **Presenter:** Tyler Gillespie **February 11, 1:00 - 2:00 CST**
**Description**: Asao Inoue asserts conventional writing assessments
privilege the white, middle- and upper-class students historically
aligned with academic discourse. To combat inequity, Inoue says
instructors should adjust “our assessment systems to favor labor over
the gifts of racial habitus." In fall 2020, Tyler Gillespie adapted Asao
Inoue's labor-based contract grading for his Writ 101 classes, and he
will discuss the framework, planning, strategies, implementation, and
student feedback in this presentation.
