| *Note: In 2020, we are transitioning away from the "Commonplace Book"
  designation in favor of "Reflection Blog."*

DWR Reflection Blogs make use of the
`Edblogs@UM <http://edblogs.olemiss.edu/>`__ platform. Edblogs is based
on WordPress, so if you’ve kept a blog before, you’ll be very familiar
with the interface. This page of the guide should address any technical
concerns you have with using student blogs in the classroom.

There are two ways to connect to your students' blogs. You may have
students add you as a user to their sites and use WordPress Reader to
access their posts or you may use the "My Class" plugin to centrally
manage your students' sites. Instructions for both methods are below.

Classes
~~~~~~~

The Classes plugin connects you to student blogs in a teacher/students
configuration. Even if you don't plan to maintain a class blog, you'll
need to have one in order to use "My Class." Your default blog is
located at "edblogs.olemiss.edu/MY-WEB-ID." Many teachers use their
default blog as a class blog. (If your default blog is not set up for
some reason, go to the `EdBlogs Signup
Page <https://edblogs.olemiss.edu/wp-signup.php>`__ to create a new
one). **|My Class > Create Class|**\ To activate your class blog, go to
the dashboard of the site you want to use as your class blog (probably
your default site) and click **My Class** and **Create a Class. ** On
the Settings page, check the box next to **This is a class blog.** This
will enable the rest of the settings and options for the Classes plugin.
Here is an explanation of each one:

-  **Allow students to post on the class blog:** Only change this
   setting if you want to require students to post to *your* blog in
   addition to their own. Most teachers do not do this. If you decide to
   use the class blog in this way, you can decide whether you want to
   moderate student posts.
-  **Moderation on student blogs:** Most teachers leave these boxes
   unchecked. This function is primarily for K-12 teachers who use the
   Campus Press platform.
-  **Privacy:** Set student site privacy to **Only registered users of
   this site can view it** by default unless you have a specific
   justification for requiring public student blogs. The nature of the
   Commonplace Book assignment lends itself to private blogs.
-  **Reader:** Leave this option unchecked unless you want students in
   your class to have access to each other's posts. If you want to
   create peer review groups or reading pairs, adding individual users
   is a better option.
-  **Teachers:** If you are team teaching a course or want to invite
   another teacher to observe your class blog, you can add other users
   as Teachers.
-  **Student Permissions:** Check all the boxes to grant students full
   control over their sites. The Commonplace Book assignment is
   predicated on student ownership of the digital space, so there's no
   good reason to restrict access to WordPress core functions.
-  **Default Blog Template:** You can automatically assign the
   Commonplace Book template to new student blogs *only* if you use the
   **Invite** function or request a batch job to enable your class blog
   at the beginning of the semester.

Adding Student Blogs to the Class
---------------------------------

| Students can request to be added to your class blog by going to **My
  Class > Join a Class **\ from their WordPress dashboard (after they've
  created a site).
| They should search for your class blog by entering just the last part
  of your class blog’s URL. For example, for
  **edblogs.olemiss.edu/mysite,** students will instead search for the
  last part of the URL. Using this example, they would search for
  **mysite.**
| You can approve student join requests by clicking on \ **My
  Class **\ and selecting which students you want to approve.
| You can have your class blog set up `automatically through the
  Teaching Hub <https://library.cwr.olemiss.edu/edblogs/>`__. We
  recommend waiting until week 2 before requesting an automatic setup to
  give your class roll a chance to stabilize.

Reader Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You do not need a separate class blog to use Reader lists to read
student Commonplace Books. This option does not use the Classes plugin
and instead relies on WordPress's native subscription/user system.

 

Creating Reader Lists
---------------------

Instead of pulling your class rolls from MyOleMiss, this time you'll
pull them from Blackboard.

**Go to the Full Grade Center** in your Blackboard course. From the
toolbar at the top of your gradebook, click "Work Offline" and select
"Download."

|image1|

**On the "Download Grades**" page under "Data," select "User Information
Only." Leave the rest of the options the same, and click "Submit."

|image2|

**On the next screen, click "Download**.\ **"** You can save the file to
your computer or open it directly in Excel. You will see the following
warning message. Click Yes:

|image3|

**The spreadsheet** will show the first and last names of the students
in the section and their usernames. Click and drag to select all the
usernames in your class, and copy them to your clipboard (Ctrl/Cmd + C).

|image4|

**Now, log in to Edblogs at
`edblogs.olemiss.edu <http://edblogs.olemiss.edu>`__**. Go to your
WordPress dashboard. You should see the Reader. Notice "My Lists" in the
right sidebar.

|image5|

**Click "Create New List."** You can name the list by section if you
want to divide your reader by section. Or, if you want all your students
combined, just name the list with the semester. Paste the usernames that
you copied from the Excel spreadsheet into the box and click "Create."

|image6|

**You can now click on the list from your Reader** to view only the
student blogs from the named section or semester. You can manage the
list by clicking the small sprocket next to its name. From the manage
screen, you can add or remove student blogs or delete the list
completely.

|image7|

**You can repeat this process** for multiple sections if you keep your
classes separated.
